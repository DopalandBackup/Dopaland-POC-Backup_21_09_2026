## 2. What changed

The sign-off response (§4.23, Decision A) recommended that **Δ_audio be formally
removed** from the POC, on the grounds that no microphone module, no capture path
and no clock-synchronisation method existed, and that the client's §10.9 makes
absent acquisition permanently disqualifying.

The client's decision was the opposite: **Δ_audio is RETAINED, and audio
acquisition is authorised.**

This reverses the vendor's own written recommendation and alters the modality set
of a frozen scope document.

---

## 3. Why this requires change control rather than a note

Scope v0.5.1 is frozen. A decision that reverses a frozen document's disposition
of an entire modality is a substantive scope change whether or not anyone regards
the added work as small.

The specific risk §18 exists to prevent is exactly the one present here: the
engineering record (`docs/AUDIO_ACQUISITION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`)
already documents the decision and everything built under it. If that were left to
stand as the whole record, the scope change would have taken effect **by drift** —
the same failure mode the response's own §4.23 argued against when it insisted the
keep-or-remove question be decided deliberately rather than by silence.

The engineering documents record that the change exists and what it produced.
**They are not the change-control record. This is.**

## 4. What has been built under this authorisation — complete list

| Component | Location |
|---|---|
| Acquisition thread (`AudioAcquisitionThread`, sounddevice callback-based, structurally decoupled from the T1/T2 video threads) | `audio_acquisition.py` |
| Per-chunk integrity logging — availability, chunk continuity, missingness; **no content analysis** | `audio_acquisition.py` |
| Independent audio consent, architecturally unreachable when declined | `stage1_step7_consent.py` |
| Env-var-only storage configuration; no committed path literal | `privacy/audio_storage_config.py` |
| Pre-commit privacy guard extended — 10 additional container extensions, 5 additional magic-byte signatures, each demonstrated firing on a real payload | `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.gitignore` |
| Feature-separation guard extended to cover `audio_acquisition.py` as direct `U_t` content | `tests/test_feature_separation.py` |
| Tests | `test_audio_acquisition`, `test_audio_storage_config`, `test_consent_audio_gate` |

---

## 5. What has explicitly NOT been built, and will not be without a separate instruction

- **No audio feature of any kind exists or is planned.** `features/audio.py`
  remains an empty stub.
- No prosody, no arousal-from-voice, no emotion-from-speech, no valence, no
  stress, no speaker state.
- Audio feature definitions remain **the client's to sign off**, under the same
  rule as every other new signal in this project.
- **G5 is preserved:** this change adds provenance, consent and integrity
  infrastructure. It adds **no new affect signal**.
- **D1 is preserved:** `U_t → X_core` and `U_t → E_t` remain forbidden and
  machine-checked. Acquisition is a `U_t`-class module and is covered by the
  separation guard as such.

## 6. What this change does *not* yet satisfy

The response's own §4.23 set two conditions for retention. Their current state:

**(a) A documented clock-synchronisation method between audio and video, with measured drift —
NOT SATISFIED, AND CLOSED AS A DOCUMENTED OMISSION.**

Nine attempts across five sessions did not produce a usable measurement. The stimulus changed
twice — hand clap with motion detection, then a brief luminance flash, then a 500 ms held flash
with a lengthened click. Two defects were found by code review and corrected before the final
attempt: the video reference timestamp marked the *end* of the flash while the audio reference
marked the *start*, biasing every offset by approximately one flash duration (predicted
−500 ms, observed −502.5 ms); and the diagnostic statistic used to characterise response
strength spanned the full window including pre-stimulus time, so ambient noise could be
reported as the stimulus response.

**Video-side registration was diagnosed and fixed** — a real and durable result. Nineteen of
nineteen evaluable emissions register cleanly at 19×–72× the detection threshold. The mechanism
was flash duration: a ~3-frame flash against a ~33 ms camera exposure period made detection
close to a coin flip, and a 500 ms held flash removed the problem entirely. Emitter operation
is confirmed directly from the diagnostic session onward — flash render and audio callback
timestamps are recorded, not assumed.

**Audio-side registration fails, and the cause is not characterised.** An earlier attribution to
ambient noise rested on the diagnostic statistic since found defective; it does not stand and is
not replaced with another. There is a specific reason the cause cannot be recovered from this
record: **the stimulus and the onset detector changed together at attempt 6** — attempts 1–5
used a hand clap with a percentile-threshold detector, attempts 6–9 a speaker-emitted click with
a rolling-median-plus-MAD detector — and no attempt isolates one from the other.

**Consequence:** Δ_audio cannot be computed. §10.9's condition is not lifted by the acquisition
build alone. A working acquisition pipeline is not a working synchronisation measurement.

This is stated under your §21 request that infeasibility be reported rather than implemented. It
is a legitimate, evidenced outcome: the video half is solved, the audio half is not, and why it
is not is honestly unknown. No further attempts are proposed.

**(b) Recorded microphone availability, audio quality and missingness per session —
INSTRUMENT ONLY.**
The logging exists; no session has been collected under it.

**Consequence, stated plainly:** the acquisition build does not on its own lift
§10.9's disqualification. Until (a) is satisfied, **Δ_audio cannot be computed**,
and retention buys a capability that is not yet usable. This record authorises the
change; it does not claim the modality is ready.

---

## 7. Consequential matrix reclassification — proposed, requires client confirmation

The client's decision resolves two rows that the response recorded as awaiting it.
The vendor proposes, the client confirms; these are **not applied** until signed.

| Row | Current | Proposed | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 19 · Modality ablation | DECISION REQUIRED | RETURNED | Contingency on Decision A is discharged. `δ_audio = 0.05` proposed on the same reasoning as the other components, to be revisited once acquisition quality is known — an unmeasured modality's achievable contribution cannot be sensibly bounded in advance. |
| 23 · Audio acquisition | DECISION REQUIRED | RETURNED *(conditional)* | Acquisition is built and has been exercised against a real microphone. The sync measurement under §6(a) is now closed as a documented omission, not outstanding work — the condition remains unmet, and no further attempt is proposed. Not EVIDENCED, because the condition the row's own text sets is unmet. |

**Resulting §19 counts if confirmed:**
12 EVIDENCED · 6 BUILT, NOT YET RUN ON REAL DATA · **11** RETURNED · **1** DECISION
REQUIRED (row 22, sensor swap) — 30 rows, none unassigned.

## 8. Cost and schedule impact — to be completed before signature

Per Decision 30, the original Rs 45,000 figure was scoped against the webcam POC,
not against this pre-registered study, and not against audio acquisition at all.

This record states that the change carries a schedule and cost consequence. It
deliberately **does not quantify it here.** Quantify it before signature, not after
— a change control signed with an empty impact field is how unpriced work becomes
contractual.

## 9. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vendor — proposed | | | |
| Client — accepted | Gargi | | |

**Nothing in this record is confirmed by appearing in it.**

## Appendix — CC-001-A: the sync measurement, closed as a documented omission

**Closed.** Nine attempts across five sessions; see §6(a). The completion test defined here —
a reported offset with a stated spread across ≥ 20 matched events plus a drift estimate — was
not met: the best attempt produced 6 matched events of 20, the final attempt 2 of 20.

The alternative outcome this appendix allowed for — "an explicit statement that the
measurement failed again and why" — is what was delivered, with the qualification that the *why* is
established only for the video half. This item is closed and requires no further work.
