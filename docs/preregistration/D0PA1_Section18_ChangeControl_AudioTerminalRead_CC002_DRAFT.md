# D0PA1 — §18 Change Control Record

**CC-002 · Audio-derived terminal interpretation (demonstration and interface only)**

> **STATUS: DRAFT — PROPOSED, NOT IN FORCE.** Nothing here takes effect by appearing in it.
> In force only once signed under §18 (§10 below).
>
> **Origin, stated plainly:** this is a **vendor-originated proposal**, not a client request.
> It is raised through change control precisely because it originates on the vendor side —
> under a pre-registration, a vendor adding capability to a frozen scope is a more serious
> matter than a client asking for it, not a lesser one.

## 1. Identification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Change reference | D0PA1-CC-002 |
| Raised by | Vendor (modeller) |
| Origin | Vendor initiative — not requested by the client |
| Frozen document affected | `D0PA1 POC Scope & Acceptance v0.5.1` |
| Related | CC-001 (audio retention); `docs/AUDIO_ACQUISITION.md` scope line |
| Date raised | 2026-09-16 |
| Status | PROPOSED |

## 2. What is proposed

A **terminal-output-only** interpretation of captured audio:

```
microphone → local extraction → Claude API → interpretation → DISPLAYED and LOGGED → dead end
```

Nothing derived from audio reaches `X_core`, `E_t`, the predictive model, calibration, the
baseline, or the target. It is a demonstration and interface capability, architecturally
identical in its position to the existing personality read.

---

## 3. Why this is architecturally permissible — the edge analysis, stated explicitly

D1's forbidden edges are:

```
FORBIDDEN:  A_t → X_core    A_t → E_t    U_t → X_core    U_t → E_t
```

The terminal LLM read is **neither `X_core` nor `E_t`**. An audio-derived value reaching a
terminal display therefore traverses no forbidden edge.

The companion rule — *the LLM read is TERMINAL OUTPUT* — constrains where the LLM's **output**
may go: never back into feature extraction, calibration, state estimation, prediction, target
construction or model updating. It places no constraint on the LLM's **input**.

**This analysis is offered for the client's scrutiny, not asserted as settled.** If the client
reads D1's intent more broadly than its literal edge list, that reading governs and this
proposal should be declined on that basis.

---

## 4. What this explicitly does NOT do

| | |
|---|---|
| **No Δ_audio** | The modality ablation is `M_core` vs `M_core + U_t` **at test time**. A terminal display never reaches the model. CC-001's retention purpose remains unmet by this change, and this proposal does not claim otherwise. |
| **No validated signal** | Any interpretation is stamped `validated:false` and described as demonstration output. "An LLM finds this voice tense" is a plausible-sounding output with no validation behind it. |
| **No new model input** | `features/audio.py` remains an empty stub. This code does not live in `features/` at all. |
| **No affect claim** | Nothing here adds to Valence, Arousal, or any vector. The V/A mapping is untouched. |
| **No verdict** | No threshold, no pass/fail, no score (G1). |

**The standing honest-framing precedent applies:** V_bf produced confident numbers and measured
nothing consistent across elicitations. Producing plausible output is not evidence of measuring
anything. This capability must never be presented as a measurement.

---

## 5. What would be built

| Component | Note |
|---|---|
| Local extraction from the captured audio stream | **Definition is the client's — see §7.** No extraction is implemented before that definition is signed. |
| Claude API call carrying the extracted representation | Not raw audio unless §7 selects that option |
| Terminal display + JSONL log, stamped `validated:false` | Same treatment as the existing personality read |
| **Machine-checkable separation guard** | Forbidden edges from this module into `x_core`, `episodes`, the model and the target — extending `tests/test_feature_separation.py`, **each demonstrated failing on a deliberate violation before being relied on**, per this repository's existing standard |
| Independent consent gate | Architecturally unreachable when declined, as with audio acquisition |
| Tests | Extraction, the guard, the consent path, and the `validated:false` stamping |

---

## 6. Privacy and consent — a material change

Audio content leaving the device is a **different posture** from the local capture authorised
under CC-001. The existing consent text, retention policy, and env-var-only storage
configuration were all written for local capture with no content analysis.

Requires, before any implementation:

- Consent language covering transmission of voice-derived content to a third-party API,
  separate from and additional to the audio-capture consent.
- A retention decision for anything transmitted or returned, including whether interpretations
  are stored at all.
- The client's position on the API provider's own data handling, which is the client's to take,
  not the vendor's to assume.

**G4 is unaffected and remains absolute:** no raw audio, and nothing derived from it, enters
git history.

---

## 7. Open decisions — the client's to make

The vendor deliberately does **not** select among these. Whatever is extracted is an audio
feature, and `docs/AUDIO_ACQUISITION.md`'s binding scope line places feature definitions with
the client.

| # | Decision | Options |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **What is extracted** | (a) non-content acoustic summary — loudness envelope, pitch contour, speech/silence ratio, turn timing; (b) a transcript; (c) both; (d) raw audio to the API |
| 2 | **What the interpretation is asked for** | open-ended description / a named set of dimensions / something narrower |
| 3 | **Whether interpretations are retained**, and for how long | |
| 4 | **Whether option (b) or (d) is acceptable at all**, given they transmit content rather than a summary | |

Option (a) is the smallest privacy footprint and the vendor's suggestion if the client wants
one — offered as a suggestion, not a selection.

---

## 8. What this does not unblock

CC-001's outstanding condition is unchanged: **no clock-synchronisation method between audio
and video exists.** Five measurement attempts across two sessions failed on the video side; no
offset, spread or drift figure exists. Alignment of any audio-derived value to video or action
timestamps remains impossible until that is measured.

For a terminal display this matters less than it would for a model input — but it must not be
described as resolved.

---

## 9. Cost and schedule impact — to be completed before signature

Per Decision 30, the Rs 45,000 figure was scoped against the webcam POC, not this
pre-registered study, and not against audio work of any kind.

This record states the change carries a cost and schedule consequence and deliberately does not
quantify it here. **Quantify before signature, not after.**

---

## 10. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vendor — proposed | | | |
| Client — accepted / declined | Gargi | | |

**Declining this is a perfectly good outcome.** It costs the engagement nothing: no dependency
in the pre-registration rests on it, and no §19 row is blocked by it.

**Nothing in this record is confirmed by appearing in it.**
