# ROI Feasibility — Can We Do It, and How Much of It Now

**Investigation only. No production code was written, changed, or wired by this task.**
Measurement scripts used to produce the numbers below were run from a scratch path and
were not committed; every number quoted here is either independently re-derived in this
session from data already committed to this repository, or cited directly from
`PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` (already committed, itself a real measurement against archived
footage). Nothing here proposes, applies, or hints at a pass/fail threshold (G1) — every
number is reported for a human to read and act on.

---

## VERDICT (Task 2.4, sharpened by the "ACT ON THE ROI FEASIBILITY VERDICT" task's Task 1) — read this first

**Horizontal (yaw) region attribution is defensible. Vertical (pitch) region
attribution is not, at any granularity tested — including the coarsest possible
version (a plain top/bottom split). This survives a symmetric re-check of both
denominators (below), but the REASON has been corrected and sharpened.** The
original phrasing of this verdict said pitch fails because "the required
separation exceeds what this pipeline's pitch channel can produce... even under
maximal, deliberate, directed effort" — implying a hard physical magnitude
ceiling. A symmetric re-measurement (§2.3–§2.5 below) found that framing was not
quite right: the pitch channel demonstrably CAN register values well above every
required separation (up to 31.2° incidentally, in the same archived clip used to
measure yaw) — so the failure is not that pitch is incapable of large values in an
absolute sense. What actually fails is DIRECTED RELIABILITY: across three real,
directed "look down" sessions, the system reads the subject as still "oriented
toward the screen" 100% of the time, every session, with zero exceptions — the
large pitch values this channel is physically capable of registering do not
show up in the logged reading when a person is told to produce them on
command. Yaw shows the opposite pattern: directed "look left"/"look right"
sessions reliably and reproducibly change the reading (`oriented_rate`
collapses from 1.00 to 0.11–0.69).

**A further correction, made explicit rather than left implicit: an earlier
version of this document stated that failure as though its MECHANISM were
established. It is not.** `oriented_rate` is a thresholded binary computed
FROM the pitch estimate, not a direct behavioral measurement, and at least
three distinct mechanisms produce exactly this logged pattern — the subject
may not have actually produced a large deflection on command; the estimator
may have failed to register a deflection that genuinely occurred; or a real,
sub-threshold movement may have been registered and then discarded by the
20°-threshold logic before it could change the reading. **§2.4a below finds
the archived data cannot separate these three, and says so plainly rather than
adopting one.** The PRACTICAL conclusion is unaffected by which of the three
turns out to be true: **vertical ROI attribution is not deliverable in this
engagement under any of them** — §2.4a restates this explicitly. What is NOT
yet established is whether that unavailability is permanent (a property of
human behaviour) or specific to this sensing approach and addressable by
different sensing in a later phase (a property of this estimator or its
threshold logic) — a real, open question this document now states as open
rather than resolving it by assertion.

Yaw, by contrast, clears its required separations by roughly 16–24× its own
resting noise floor, confirmed against two independent sets of real archived data
— and clears comfortably under every "achievable deflection" comparator measured
in §2.3–§2.5 as well.

**The largest honest claim available: a coarse (2- or plausibly 3-way) left/right
region attribution, plus the existing binary "oriented toward the screen" scalar and
its lateral direction.** Both are supported by real data collected in this repository.
Neither is currently validated to the client's own D8 statistical standard — that
validation is a separate, not-yet-run step (see Task 1.2) — but the *underlying
signal*, unlike pitch, is physically capable of carrying the discrimination this
claim requires. One caveat attaches to even this claim: the existing "oriented"
scalar blends yaw and pitch (`max(yaw_frac, pitch_frac)`), so a person looking down —
the single most common real disengagement behaviour — will misleadingly score as
"oriented," inheriting pitch's blind spot into the surviving claim. This is not a new
finding; CLAUDE.md's own "Attention / screen-orientation" section already says so. It
is repeated here because it directly bounds how much weight even the *surviving* claim
can honestly carry.

**⚠️ UPDATE, "AFTER THE PHYSICAL RUN" task — the paragraph above describing
`oriented_rate` staying 1.00 with zero exceptions is now PARTIALLY WRONG, not
just under-explained, and this update corrects it rather than only
re-flagging it a third time.** Real, graded-intensity, independently-judged
directed pitch data now exists (§2.7 below is the full re-derivation; this is
the short version). At MAXIMAL commanded effort, large pitch values (up to
−43.1°, two attempts averaging −31.6° and −15.2°) genuinely DO register — the
"large values never show up" claim was true of every session tested before
this one, but is no longer true in general. **What replaces it, re-derived
from the real numbers rather than re-asserted: the practical verdict is
unchanged (vertical ROI attribution is still not deliverable, at any tested
granularity), but the REASON has moved a second time** — from "directed
reliability" (implying the value itself doesn't show up) to **availability**
(the value shows up, but a usable reading exists for only 8–27% of a
maximal-effort look-down attempt, using this task's own cycle-based
detection-rate accounting — see §2.7.2 for the important caveat on what that
percentage actually measures) **plus a secondary, real consistency problem**
(two equally-judged-maximal attempts differed by roughly 2× in magnitude).
Magnitude itself is favourable at maximal effort but is NOT solved at
ordinary/moderate look-down intensity — §2.7.1's own numbers show required
separations still exceed what a "slight" or "moderate" commanded glance
produced. §2.7 is the full derivation; the VERDICT paragraphs above are left
as originally corrected (not rewritten a third time in place) so this
document's own history of what was claimed, when, stays legible — read this
note as superseding their specific "oriented_rate stays 1.00... large values
do not show up" claim, not the document's bottom-line verdict.

---

## RETRACTION — a withdrawn claim, recorded rather than silently replaced

**The claim, as originally stated** (commit `8f1b9f2`, this document's first
version): pitch fails because "the required separation exceeds even the most
generous real signal available" — reported as a ≈2.0× ratio (Quadrants/pitch:
8.84° required ÷ ≤4.4° achievable; Top/bottom halves: the same 8.84°÷≤4.4°) —
presented as a magnitude ceiling. The clear implication: pitch cannot
physically produce enough deflection to distinguish two vertically-adjacent
regions, at any layout, ever.

**That claim was wrong, and this document's own symmetric re-check disproved
it.** §2.3's natural-movement-max comparator, applying the identical
methodology already used for yaw to pitch for the first time, found pitch
reaching **31.2°** in the same archived clip (`test_clip.mp4`) — nearly 3.5×
the quadrant layout's 8.84° requirement, and over 5× the coarsest top/bottom
split's requirement. Under that comparator every pitch ratio is favourable
(0.19–0.28×), the direct opposite of the original ≈2.0× "required exceeds
achievable" claim. The magnitude-ceiling framing does not survive contact with
this document's own later, more careful measurement.

**What actually replaced it** (commit `7473742`, same session the asymmetry
was closed): the corrected finding in §2.3–§2.5 — pitch's failure is a
**directed-reproducibility** problem (a real, deliberate "look down" attempt
does not register, even though the channel is proven capable of registering
much larger values incidentally), not a hard physical ceiling on what the
channel can ever produce. The PRACTICAL verdict (vertical ROI attribution is
not deliverable) did not change; the MECHANISM claimed for it did, materially.

**Was this sent to the client before the correction?** No. Per
`docs/preregistration/README.md`, nothing in `docs/preregistration/` — the
only documents in this repository ever intended for client delivery — has
been sent to the client as of any commit in this repository's history, and
this document itself has never been referenced anywhere as delivered. The
magnitude-ceiling framing was superseded (commit `7473742`) in the same
repository state it was introduced (commit `8f1b9f2`), before either version
left this repository.

**Why this is recorded explicitly, rather than left as a diff between two
commits for someone to reconstruct:** a withdrawn claim that is visibly
withdrawn costs nothing — a reader of this document today sees exactly what
was claimed, that it was wrong, and what replaced it. A claim that is silently
swapped between revisions is what destroys a document's credibility the day
someone diffs two versions and finds a number changed with no explanation
attached. This paragraph is that explanation, kept where a reader of the
document will actually encounter it, not only in a commit message.

## 1. Inventory (Task 1)

### 1.1 Screen regions, bounding boxes, clicks, keypresses, on-screen actions, task events

**Nothing in this repository defines, stores, or consumes any of these with real
content.** Searched exhaustively (`roi`, `ROI`, `bounding.?box`, `screen_region`,
`click`, `keypress`, `on_screen`, `task_event`, `region_id`, case-insensitive, whole
repository). Every hit falls into one of two categories:

- **Documentation describing the absence** — `docs/D1_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md`,
  `features/context.py`, `features/manifests/context_v1.json`, `features/__init__.py`,
  and CLAUDE.md itself, all stating plainly that ROI/context code does not exist.
- **The canonical schema's declared-but-unpopulated field shapes** —
  `schema/canonical_log_v1.json` / `schema/canonical_log_writer.py` define
  `stimulus_id`, `stimulus_onset`, `roi_or_condition`, `prediction_timestamp`,
  `action_timestamp`, `action_class` as real fields on `canonical_observation`
  records, every one of them typed `["string","null"]` or `["number","null"]` and
  defaulting to `None` in `write_observation()`'s signature. **No code anywhere in
  this repository ever supplies a non-null value for any of these fields.** This is
  the schema's own documented intent — see `schema/canonical_log_v1.json`'s
  `$comment`: *"these fields exist because the client's task harness... will
  eventually populate them — this schema defines the SHAPE those fields must have; it
  does not define the action-class vocabulary itself."*

One false-positive worth naming so it isn't mistaken for a hit: `stage3_demo_ui.py`
has keypress/mouse-click handling, but it is Tkinter window-close chrome (closing the
demo dashboard), unrelated to any task/ROI semantics — confirmed by reading the
surrounding code, not assumed from the grep match.

**Conclusion: Obstacle A (no event source) is total, not partial.** There is no
partially-built ROI ingestion path to extend — the schema has a shape waiting to be
filled, and nothing else.

### 1.2 Full inventory of existing attention-class code

All of it lives in `features/attention.py` (the A_t block), imported by three
consumers (`stage1_step4_vectors.py`, `stage3_demo_ui.py`, `orientation_capture.py`)
that call it identically but log/display it differently (see §4's caveat on this).

| Item | What it computes | Output | Record type / file | Validated? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `compute_v_so` | Screen-orientation score: `0.7×pose_score + 0.3×gaze_score` (or pose-only if gaze implausible); pose_score from `max(yaw_frac, pitch_frac)` against a 20° threshold on each axis | `orientation_score` (float 0–1), `components` dict incl. `oriented` (bool), `head_pose_only` (bool) | `record["screen_orientation"]` in `sample` records; aggregated into `attention_window_summary` via `AttentionWindowAccumulator.flush()` | **No.** Stamped `"unvalidated": true` on every record. Yaw component behaves correctly on real data (§2.2); pitch component does not (§2.2, §2.4). |
| `_gaze_centering_score` | Secondary/bonus input to `compute_v_so` — how centred the iris sits between eye corners, averaged across both eyes | `(score, reliable)` tuple, never surfaced independently | Consumed internally by `compute_v_so` only | Unvalidated (same status as V_so overall) |
| `compute_gaze_direction` | Coarse **LEFT / RIGHT / CENTER / UNKNOWN** label from the signed difference between the two eyes' iris-centring ratios | `(label, reliable, raw_shift)` | `record["gaze_direction"]` in `sample` records (stage3/orientation_capture consumers only); `logs/experimental_signals_log.jsonl` | **No.** Explicitly experimental, `"unvalidated": true`. Never up/down by design — same pitch-unreliable reasoning as V_so, deliberately never attempted. |
| `BlinkDetector` | Blinks/minute via a relative-threshold state machine over V_es's own aperture value | rate_per_min, diagnostic fields | `logs/experimental_signals_log.jsonl` | **Partially** — the positive blink control (`controls/blink_positive.py`) validates detection against synthetic ground truth; no real clip exists (see `docs/MATRIX_ROW_MAP.md` row 15). Not ROI-relevant on its own but is attention-class and lives in the same module. |
| `AttentionWindowAccumulator` | Windows `compute_v_so`'s per-sample output into 10s avg/peak/variance + `oriented_rate`, `gaze_reliable_rate`, `look_away_rate` — its own independent clock, never touching `WindowAccumulator`/`NeutralCalibrator` | `attention_window_summary` record | Own record type, own file position within `logs/session_*.jsonl` | Unvalidated (inherits V_so's status) |
| `orientation_capture.py` | A dedicated **directed-capture study tool** — 6 fixed segments (`look_at_screen`, `look_left`, `look_right`, `look_down`, `look_up`, `look_away_and_back`), each ~10s, using the real `AttentionWindowAccumulator` unmodified, plus (schema 1.1) per-segment raw yaw/pitch/roll avg/min/max/variance | `orientation_trial` record | `logs/orientation_trials.jsonl` | This *is* the validation study tool — dumb capture, no scoring in-tool, same discipline as Gate 2's capture tool. It has produced 18 real records (3 sessions × 6 segments) to date, all under schema 1.0 (pre-dating the raw-pitch field — see §2.2). |

No dwell, persistence, switching, or head-gaze-coherence code exists anywhere — those
are the exact ROI-dependent derivatives that cannot exist without Obstacle A. Nothing
was found under any name.

### 1.3 Where A_t lives and what the separation test does for it

`features/attention.py` is a single, flat block-module file — one of the five named
blocks the D1 architecture defines
(`geometry`/`x_core`/`episodes`/`attention`/`audio`/`context`). ROI, dwell,
persistence, switching, and head-gaze coherence are all named explicitly, by CLAUDE.md
itself, as belonging inside this one file (*"attention.py A_t -- attention (ROI,
orientation, dwell, persistence, switching, head-gaze coherence, and ANY downstream
attention derivative)"*).

**The machinery to hold this work is already in place; nothing new needs
scaffolding.** Concretely, from reading `tests/test_feature_separation.py` directly:

- `BLOCK_MODULES` already includes `"attention"` — any new function added inside
  `features/attention.py` is automatically part of the module the static import
  graph (check 1), static call graph (check 2), and runtime monkeypatch (check 3)
  all already parse and poison.
- `FORBIDDEN_EDGES` already includes `("x_core","attention")` and
  `("episodes","attention")` — a new ROI/dwell function added inside `attention.py`
  is automatically covered by the exact same forbidden-edge check that already
  protects V_so, gaze, and blink. No new edge needs adding for attention-internal
  growth.
- Check 4 (`check_shim_isolation`) discovers cross-block shims *by definition* (any
  repo-root module whose AST imports `features.attention`) — a new ROI consumer
  written as, say, a new root-level analysis script would be caught by this exact
  mechanism the moment it imported `features.attention`, with zero changes needed.

**What is *not* already covered, and would need new scaffolding, is anything that
lands in `features/context.py` instead of `features/attention.py`** — see Task 4
below; this is the one genuine gap, and it is a pre-existing, already-documented one
(`features/context.py`'s own docstring names it), not something ROI work introduces.

### 1.4 The clock

Every `sample` record (`stage1_step4_vectors.py`) carries two timestamps:
`ts_utc` (`datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()`, wall-clock, ISO-8601) and
`ts_monotonic` (`cycle_start`, sourced from `time.perf_counter()`) — captured at the
same instant, every processing cycle. `window_summary`/`attention_window_summary`
records carry `window_start_monotonic`/`window_end_monotonic`, also `perf_counter()`-
sourced, no wall-clock companion at the window level (only at sample level).
Resolution: `time.perf_counter()`'s resolution is sub-millisecond on Windows; the
practical resolution of the signal itself is the ~30–33ms inter-frame interval
(`docs/LOG_EVIDENCE.md`: measured mean inter-sample interval 33.5ms, ~29.8Hz), not the
clock's own precision.

**The canonical schema already contains the exact mechanism needed to align this
pipeline's monotonic clock with an externally-arriving event log's own clock** —
`schema/canonical_log_writer.py`'s `CanonicalLogWriter.open_session()`. It captures
`wall_clock_utc` (`datetime.now`) and `monotonic_reference` (`time.perf_counter()`) at
the same instant, once per session, specifically so *"every later monotonic timestamp
in the session is interpretable as real time"* (the schema doc's own words). This is
the **exact integration point**: a harness delivering its own event log, each event
carrying its own wall-clock time, can be reconciled with this pipeline's
`ts_monotonic`/`window_start_monotonic` values by converting both sides through their
own wall-clock anchor into a shared wall-clock frame, then re-expressing the offset in
whichever clock the join needs. `action_timestamp`/`stimulus_onset` are the fields
already declared, on `canonical_observation`, to hold exactly this — monotonic,
cross-checked for per-field monotonicity within a session — waiting for a value.

**This mechanism has never been exercised with two independent clock domains.**
Gate 0's `RunProvenance`/`capture_run_provenance` and the canonical schema both exist
and are tested in isolation (`docs/MATRIX_ROW_MAP.md` rows 27/28); neither has ever
been called against a second, genuinely separate process's clock. The design is
sound and already built; the empirical question ("how much do two independent
Windows-process monotonic clocks actually drift over a session") is untested and
cannot be tested until a second real clock (the harness's) exists.

## 2. The resolution measurement (Task 2)

### 2.1 Required angular separation, computed

**Assumptions, stated explicitly:**
- Screen: 14-inch diagonal, 16:9 laptop panel → **30.0cm × 17.0cm** (exact 16:9 math
  on a 14in diagonal gives 30.5cm × 17.2cm; rounded for a clean number, immaterial to
  the conclusion at this precision).
- Viewing distance: **55cm**, a standard mid-point of common laptop-ergonomics
  guidance (~50–70cm).
- Eye assumed level with screen centre for the horizontal (yaw) calculation, and the
  vertical (pitch) calculation is the *differential* between region centres only — it
  does not depend on where the whole screen sits relative to eye height, only on how
  far apart two region centres are, angularly, from each other.
- Angles computed as `atan(offset_cm / distance_cm)`, i.e. the true angle subtended at
  the eye, not a small-angle linear approximation (though at these distances the two
  agree to within a few hundredths of a degree).

**Arithmetic, and the result** (script run this session, not committed; the inputs
above fully reproduce it):

| Layout | Cell size | Adjacent horizontal (yaw) separation | Adjacent vertical (pitch) separation | Axis stressed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Halves (1×2, left/right) | 15.0 × 17.0cm | **15.53°** | 0° (single row) | Yaw only |
| Quadrants (2×2) | 15.0 × 8.5cm | **15.53°** | **8.84°** | Both |
| 3×3 grid | 10.0 × 5.7cm | **10.30°** (both adjacent pairs) | **5.88°** (both adjacent pairs) | Both |

A plain top/bottom halves split (not in the client's named layouts, but worth
computing since it isolates the pitch axis at its coarsest possible granularity) would
require the same **8.84°** as the quadrant layout's vertical component, since both
split the same 17cm height into two equal rows.

### 2.2 What this system actually delivers, measured

**No suitable archived webcam footage exists on this machine right now for a fresh,
independent frame-by-frame re-measurement — checked directly, not assumed.** Three
candidate video files were found locally (`C:\Users\Abcom\Downloads\*.mp4`, dated
mid-July 2026) and systematically sampled (10 evenly-spaced frames each, run through
the real, unmodified `FaceLandmarker`): **0/10, 0/10, and 1/9 sampled frames had a
detected face.** Their resolution (1896×950, ~25fps, 5–66 minutes long) and near-total
absence of any detectable face confirm these are screen recordings (a `ScreenRec`
installer is present on this machine), not webcam footage of a person — unrelated to
this question. The two clips `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` previously analysed frame-by-frame
(`test_clip.mp4`, `directed_clip.mp4`) no longer exist anywhere on this machine or in
this repository (confirmed: zero `.mp4`/`.mov`/`.avi` files anywhere under
`C:\Dopaland-POC`, consistent with G4 — raw media is never committed). **Per this
task's own instruction, this sub-task stops there rather than recording a number
against unsuitable footage.** What would be needed to re-run it fresh: 1–2 minutes of
real webcam footage of a seated subject performing a directed "look at screen / look
down / look up" sequence — exactly what `orientation_capture.py` is built to produce,
and exactly the physical-run item already listed as outstanding in
`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.

**What *is* available, and was used instead, is real archived measurement data
already committed to this repository** — not raw video, but the actual numeric output
of processing real footage, which is what the noise-floor/range questions need
either way:

**Yaw noise floor** (head held still, `look_at_screen` segments, 3 real capture
sessions, `logs/orientation_trials.jsonl`, re-extracted this session):

| Session | `yaw_variance_deg2` | std (deg) |
|---|---|---|
| ddbc2c0f | 0.5408 | 0.735 |
| 1fd37ee4 | 0.1503 | 0.388 |
| ad539d4a | 0.6622 | 0.814 |

Pooled (mean variance 0.4511 deg²): **std ≈ 0.65°.** This is a real number from real,
held-still footage — three independent sessions, consistent range 0.39–0.81°.

**Yaw usable range**: `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s own frame-by-frame scan of
`test_clip.mp4` (real footage, 816 detected frames) found `|yaw|` ranging **16.1°–
78.4°** (mean 36.3°) during natural head movement — real, large, easily-detected
excursions. Corroborating this from `orientation_trials.jsonl`: `look_left`/
`look_right` segments (3 sessions) show `oriented_rate` collapsing to **0.11–0.69**
(from 1.00 at rest) — the same tool, on the same real subjects, robustly registers
real yaw excursions as a behavioural change, not just as a quiet noise increase.

**The pitch finding — reproduced, from two independent real-data sources:**

1. **`PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s frame-by-frame video scan** (real footage,
   `directed_clip.mp4`, already committed, not re-run by this session but its
   numbers are the actual measured output of real data): during the clip's directed
   "look down" phase, pitch stayed **0–5°, never exceeding ~4.4°**, across the whole
   ~10s window — while the *same pitch channel*, in the *same clip*, registered
   **15–18°** incidentally elsewhere (a settling motion, not a commanded look-down).
2. **This session's fresh extraction of `orientation_trials.jsonl`** (3 real
   sessions, never previously tabulated this way): `look_down`'s `oriented_rate` is
   **1.00, 1.00, 1.00** — indistinguishable from `look_at_screen`'s own 0.789–0.934
   average orientation score. `look_up`: **0.93, 0.86, 1.00** — same pattern, slightly
   less extreme. Every one of 6 real directed vertical-look attempts, across 3
   different real sessions, reads as "still oriented at the screen." Zero exceptions.

**Both sources agree, independently: the pitch finding reproduces.** A real,
deliberate, sustained "look down" command produces a system readout that is not
reliably distinguishable from sitting still and looking at the screen.

### 2.3 Closing the asymmetry — defining "achievable deflection" once, for both axes

The table originally reported here compared yaw against its resting NOISE FLOOR
(a favourable denominator: a large ratio is good) and pitch against an
ACHIEVABLE-DEFLECTION figure (an unfavourable denominator: a ratio above 1 is
bad) — an inconsistent comparison for a client-facing document, and the exact
gap the "ACT ON THE ROI FEASIBILITY VERDICT" task's Task 1 asked to be closed.
This section replaces it with both denominators computed for both axes, using
one explicitly-stated definition applied identically.

**Definition, stated explicitly:** "achievable deflection" = the maximum angular
value actually observed during a DIRECTED (commanded) attempt at the relevant
look, measured by frame-by-frame video scan of archived footage. This is exactly
what the original pitch figure (≤4.4°) already used — the maximum value reached
during `directed_clip.mp4`'s own labeled "look down" phase, explicitly excluding
an incidental 15–18° reading recorded elsewhere in the same clip outside that
phase (`PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` §2b).

**Applying that same definition to yaw finds a genuine data gap, not a symmetric
number.** No raw-degree measurement from a DIRECTED look-left/look-right session
exists anywhere in this repository: `logs/orientation_trials.jsonl` (schema
version 1.0) predates the raw yaw/pitch degree fields `orientation_capture.py`
now supports — it logged only the derived `oriented_rate` score for those
directed segments, never a raw angle. This is stated plainly rather than papered
over with a substitute presented as equivalent (G3).

**The one dataset genuinely comparable across axes** is `test_clip.mp4`'s
frame-by-frame scan (`PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` §2b) — the SAME clip, SAME scan
methodology, applied to both channels simultaneously, though measuring NATURAL
(undirected) head movement, not a directed attempt:

| Axis | Range observed (test_clip.mp4, natural movement) | Max |
|---|---|---|
| Yaw | 16.1°–78.4° (mean 36.3°) | **78.4°** |
| Pitch | 0.1°–31.2° (mean 8.8°) | **31.2°** |

This is flagged explicitly as a DIFFERENT methodology than the directed-effort
definition above (natural vs. commanded movement) — reported as a labelled,
lower-confidence proxy, not silently substituted as if identical.

### 2.4 The four-number table

Three genuinely distinct denominators appear below, each labelled for what it
actually is; a layout's cell is left blank where no matching real measurement
exists, rather than filled with an invented number (G2/G3):

| Layout | Axis | Required | Noise floor (directed-session, resting) | Ratio | Natural-movement max (test_clip.mp4, undirected) | Ratio | Directed-effort max (commanded attempt) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Halves | Yaw | 15.53° | 0.65° | **≈24×** (favourable) | 78.4° | **≈0.20×** (favourable — required well within max) | *no raw-degree directed figure exists* | — |
| Quadrants | Yaw | 15.53° | 0.65° | **≈24×** (favourable) | 78.4° | **≈0.20×** (favourable) | *no raw-degree directed figure exists* | — |
| Quadrants | Pitch | 8.84° | *no archived resting figure exists (§2.2)* | — | 31.2° | **≈0.28×** (favourable — required well within max) | ≤4.4° | **≈2.0×** *(unfavourable — required exceeds achievable)* |
| 3×3 grid | Yaw | 10.30° | 0.65° | **≈16×** (favourable) | 78.4° | **≈0.13×** (favourable) | *no raw-degree directed figure exists* | — |
| 3×3 grid | Pitch | 5.88° | *no archived resting figure exists* | — | 31.2° | **≈0.19×** (favourable) | ≤4.4° | **≈1.3×** *(unfavourable)* |
| Top/bottom halves | Pitch | 8.84° | *no archived resting figure exists* | — | 31.2° | **≈0.28×** (favourable) | ≤4.4° | **≈2.0×** *(unfavourable)* |

For the noise-floor and directed-effort columns, ratio = required ÷ measured, and
a ratio **above** 1 is unfavourable (required exceeds what's available). For the
natural-movement-max column, ratio = required ÷ max observed, and a ratio
**below** 1 is favourable (required separation sits comfortably inside the range
this channel has been observed to reach, even without being told to).

**Does the verdict survive the symmetric comparison unchanged? No — not
unchanged, and the honest answer is more interesting than a plain yes or no.**
Under the one column that is genuinely symmetric (natural-movement max, same
clip, same method, both axes), **pitch's required separations also clear** —
every pitch ratio in that column is comfortably below 1, the same favourable
direction as yaw's. Read superficially, this reverses the original verdict. It
does not, for a specific, statable reason: the natural-movement-max column
answers "can this channel ever register a value this large", which pitch
demonstrably can (31.2° observed, incidentally, in ordinary footage) — but the
ROI-attribution question this document exists to answer is "can a person
reliably PRODUCE that value when asked to look at a specific region", which is
what the directed-effort column measures, and that column is the one where
pitch fails at every layout including the coarsest possible one, with no
corresponding yaw figure to compare against (a genuine gap, not filled in). The
corroborating evidence for treating directed-effort as decisive is behavioural,
not just the two raw-degree clips: `orientation_trials.jsonl`'s three real
directed sessions show `look_down`'s `oriented_rate` at **1.00, 1.00, 1.00** —
zero exceptions, indistinguishable from resting — while `look_left`/`look_right`
reliably collapse to **0.11–0.69**. Yaw's directed sessions change the reading;
pitch's directed sessions do not, even though the same pitch channel is proven
capable of registering values that would change it. **That is the corrected
finding this document's earlier revision surfaced: the failure shows up
specifically under directed attempts, not as a hard magnitude ceiling** — worth
stating precisely because a magnitude ceiling could in principle be routed
around by a coarser layout, and this specific failure cannot (§2.5 shows it
fails even the coarsest possible top/bottom split). **What that same revision
did NOT establish, and stated more confidently than it should have, is WHY the
directed attempt fails to register — see §2.4a, which separates the
established failure from its not-yet-separated mechanism.**

### 2.4a The mechanism is not yet established (M1 / M2 / M3)

**⚠️ UPDATE, real data, "PHYSICAL RUN SESSION" task — this section's
analysis below was written from archived data only and is now
PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED. Read this note before the rest of §2.4a.** A real,
graded-intensity, independently-judged directed pitch capture was run
(not archived data — a live session, `logs/orientation_trials.jsonl`,
labels `look_down_small_1`/`look_down_medium_1`/`_2`/`look_down_maximal_1`/`_2`).
**Maximal, genuinely-held attempts registered pitch as large as −43.1°**
(two attempts, both independently judged "genuine maximal effort" before
the number was shown: −31.6° avg and −15.2° avg), with rough scaling by
commanded intensity (small≈6° → medium≈2–3° → maximal≈15–32°) — this
directly contradicts the ≤4.4° figure this section's own §2.2/§2.3 built
the "directed effort caps out low" framing on, and contradicts CLAUDE.md's
now-corrected "verified chin-to-chest... ~0.1°" claim even more sharply.
**M3 (threshold artefact) is now further weakened as an explanation**
(real registered values FAR exceed the 20° `ATTENTION_PITCH_THRESHOLD_DEG`,
so nothing is being discarded by that gate in the maximal case) — and
**M1 (behavioural non-production) looks less likely too**, since both
attempts were independently confirmed as genuine before the number was
known. What is NOT resolved: (a) DETECTION RATE during every pitch
attempt stayed low (0.08%–27%) even when pitch DID register — most of
each window still produced no reading, a distinct problem from magnitude,
and arguably now the more interesting open M2-adjacent question:
INTERMITTENT tracking loss, not a wrong VALUE; (b) a sign inconsistency
between medium (positive) and maximal (negative) readings, unexplained;
(c) both maximal attempts judged equally genuine produced magnitudes
differing ~2× (−31.6° vs −15.2°) — real evidence the ESTIMATOR is
inconsistent even when it does register something, independent of
subject behaviour; (d) n=1 subject, one session, two maximal reps — this
reversal itself rests on thin evidence and must not be overstated into
"pitch now works." Full numbers: `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "Directed
pitch capture" entry. **This section's own verdict-level text below
(§2.4a's "my own reading," §2.5's granularity table, and the top-of-document
VERDICT) has NOT yet been rewritten to reflect this** — flagged here so a
future session does not read the unrevised text below as still current
without also reading this note.

**✅ Done by the "AFTER THE PHYSICAL RUN" task: §2.7 below is that rewrite.**
It re-derives the resolution comparison (§2.1's table) using ONLY this real
graded data plus the resting noise floor already established, separates the
magnitude question from the (now-dominant) availability/detection-rate
question, and restates the verdict against all three candidate grounds
(magnitude / consistency / availability) explicitly, rather than leaving
that synthesis to a future session again. The top-of-document VERDICT
carries its own short pointer to the same section. §2.4a's mechanism
question (M1/M2/M3) itself is NOT what §2.7 re-derives — that stays as this
section leaves it (undifferentiated, n=1) — §2.7 is about the RESOLUTION
verdict (§2.1–§2.5), a related but distinct question this document has kept
visibly separate throughout.

`oriented_rate` — the value every directed-session figure above is built
from — is a thresholded binary derived FROM `compute_v_so`'s pitch estimate,
not a direct record of what the subject's head actually did. At least three
distinct, genuinely different mechanisms produce exactly the same logged
pattern (`look_down`'s `oriented_rate` = 1.00 across all three real sessions):

- **M1 — BEHAVIOURAL.** The subject did not actually produce a large
  deflection on command.
- **M2 — ESTIMATOR.** The subject did move, and the pitch estimator failed to
  register it — the failure mode face-foreshortening-degraded landmarks would
  produce.
- **M3 — THRESHOLD ARTIFACT.** Real, sub-threshold movement was registered by
  the estimator but discarded by the 20° `ATTENTION_PITCH_THRESHOLD_DEG` logic
  before it reached `oriented_rate`.

**Can the archived data separate them? Mostly no — stated plainly, with the
negative findings that establish it:**

- `logs/orientation_trials.jsonl` (the 18 real directed-session records) was
  read record-by-record this session: its fields are `schema_version,
  record_type, session_id, participant_code, commanded_label, segment_index,
  ts_utc, hold_seconds, n_samples, n_detected, detection_rate,
  screen_orientation, gaze_direction, look_away_rate, window_quality,
  unvalidated, label`. `screen_orientation` carries only the derived 0–1
  score (avg/peak/variance/`oriented_rate`); `window_quality` carries only
  `yaw_variance_deg2`. **No raw pitch value, per-frame or per-record, exists
  anywhere in this file** — schema version 1.0 predates the raw-angle field
  entirely. For these three sessions, M1/M2/M3 are **completely
  undifferentiated** by anything logged.
- `orientation_capture.py` was checked directly: its CURRENT code (schema
  `"1.1"`, `SCHEMA_VERSION` at line 111) already collects raw per-frame
  yaw/pitch/roll during each segment and aggregates them (avg/min/max/variance
  via `_raw_angle_stats`) into a `raw_head_pose_deg` field on the trial
  record — built as a `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` follow-up. **This machinery has
  never been exercised**: all 18 archived records are schema 1.0, predating
  it; zero schema-1.1 records exist anywhere in this repository. A re-run
  under the current tool would already log raw pitch min/max/avg per segment
  — useful, but still segment-aggregated, not the full per-frame time series
  Task 3 below asks for, and still without any independent ground truth of
  what the subject's head actually did (see next point).
- `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s frame-by-frame scan of `directed_clip.mp4` (§2b) IS
  raw, per-frame, unthresholded pitch data for one directed "look down"
  segment — the ≤4.4° figure comes directly from it, not from a derived
  score. This lets M3 be **ruled out for that one segment specifically**: the
  raw value itself stayed low (0–5°) throughout, so nothing was "a real
  ~15° movement discarded by the threshold" in that case — the raw reading
  never reached a magnitude for the threshold to discard. **But this does not
  separate M1 from M2**, because the scan is a re-examination of the SAME
  estimator's own output over more frames — not an independent check of what
  the subject's head physically did. No human visual review of the video
  frames themselves, no operator observation, and no second sensor is
  documented anywhere as part of that scan. Both video files it analysed
  (`test_clip.mp4`, `directed_clip.mp4`) no longer exist on this machine
  (confirmed again this session) and were never committed (G4) — so this
  specific scan cannot be redone or extended.
- Several POC-era `logs/session_*.jsonl` files (checked this session, e.g.
  `session_09a3bc97-...jsonl`, 1,232 `sample` records) DO carry real
  per-frame `head_pose.pitch_deg` — but from ordinary Gate-2-era captures
  (smile/furrow/concentrate/sit-still/fidget), with no commanded look
  direction and no independent record of what the subject's head was doing.
  These do not help separate M1/M2/M3 either, for the same reason: real raw
  pitch, but no directed-look experimental design and no independent ground
  truth alongside it.
- **No file anywhere in this repository's history contains an independent,
  non-estimator-based ground truth of head position** (a human's frame-by-
  frame visual judgement, an operator's live observation recorded
  alongside the numeric reading, or a second sensor) for any "look down"
  attempt examined to date — confirmed by search (`git log --all -- '*.csv'
  '*pitch*' '*diagnostic*'` and a repo-wide file search for pitch-related
  artefacts) and by reading every candidate document directly.

**Which mechanism does the existing evidence lean toward? I do not agree that
it leans toward M2, and I want to be specific about why, since I was asked to
check this rather than adopt it.** The one piece of evidence that would most
directly support M2 is CLAUDE.md's own STATUS section: *"on a maximal,
sustained, **verified** chin-to-chest look-down, pitch stayed ~0.1° and
`oriented_rate` stayed 1.0."* Read at face value, "verified" implies an
independent confirmation that the movement occurred, which would indeed point
at M2. But under direct examination this session, that claim does not hold up
to the weight the word "verified" puts on it:

1. **No documented verification method exists anywhere in this repository**
   for that specific claim — no operator log, no saved video, no frame-by-
   frame review, no second observer. A search for "chin-to-chest" across the
   repository (`grep -ri`) finds it stated as fact in `CLAUDE.md`,
   `stage1_step4_vectors.py`'s docstring, and `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — all
   three restating the same claim, none of them citing a method behind it.
2. **It is numerically inconsistent with the one figure in this repository
   that IS backed by a documented method** — `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s
   frame-by-frame `directed_clip.mp4` scan, a LATER and more careful
   investigation, found the directed "look down" segment's pitch reaching
   ≤4.4°, not ~0.1°. These may describe different sessions, but nothing in
   this repository states that, and the order of magnitude difference (0.1°
   vs. 4.4°, roughly 40×) is exactly the kind of discrepancy that should be
   flagged, not smoothed over.
3. **`PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s own author — investigating this exact question
   more carefully and later than the "verified" claim was written — explicitly
   declines to treat M1 as ruled out**: its §4 states, in full acknowledgement
   of the residual uncertainty, *"I cannot fully rule out that the specific
   humans/attempts behind these four 'look down' windows simply didn't
   perform a large enough sustained tilt."* Its §5 then proposes, as FUTURE,
   NOT-YET-DONE work, *"a monitored, in-person directed capture (operator
   watching live...) with an explicit, VERIFIED maximal chin-to-chest
   hold, cross-checked frame-by-frame against the printed pitch value in
   real time."* Proposing a genuinely verified chin-to-chest test as
   still-needed future work would be redundant if a genuinely verified
   instance with a clear result already existed. This is the strongest
   single piece of evidence against reading the earlier "verified" claim as
   settling the question.

**My own reading:** M3 is partially ruled out, for the one segment where raw,
unthresholded data was directly examined (`directed_clip.mp4`'s look-down
phase) — not for the three real `orientation_trials.jsonl` sessions, where it
remains fully open. M1 and M2 are **genuinely undifferentiated by anything
currently in this repository** — every existing "confirmation" is itself
derived from the same estimator being questioned, and the one claim that
would independently support M2 lacks a documented method, is numerically
inconsistent with the more careful investigation, and is treated as unresolved
by that same later investigation's own author. I am not adopting "leans toward
M2" as this document's position. The honest statement is: **the failure is
established and reproduced from two independent sources (§2.2); the mechanism
behind it is not yet separated, and this document does not know which of M1,
M2, or M3 (or some mixture) is responsible.**

**Why the distinction matters, stated in one paragraph, as this task asked:**
M1 is a property of human behaviour under this specific instruction
and setup — if true, it closes the question permanently for THIS kind of
sensing, regardless of what estimator or hardware a later phase might use,
because no estimator can register a movement the subject never made. M2 (and,
narrower, M3) are properties of THIS head-pose estimator and its current
threshold implementation specifically — if true, they could in principle be
addressed by different sensing, a different estimator, or a different
threshold in a later phase, without implying the underlying human behaviour is
unmeasurable in general. Conflating the three either overclaims a permanent
impossibility (if M2/M3 turn out to be true) or understates a real,
behaviourally-grounded limit (if M1 turns out to be true) — exactly the kind
of overclaim/understate error G3 exists to prevent.

**The practical verdict, restated so this correction is not read as a
reprieve:** regardless of which of M1, M2, or M3 turns out to be responsible,
**vertical ROI attribution is not deliverable in this engagement, under any of
the three.** Only the FUTURE is in question here — whether a later phase,
with different sensing or a genuinely verified capture, could recover
something this phase cannot — not the PRESENT deliverable, which does not
exist under any mechanism. §3 (the capture protocol below) is what would
settle which mechanism is responsible; it is specified, not built, and
settling it is future work, not a precondition for today's verdict.

### 2.5 The verdict, and the largest honest claim

See the top of this document for the full verdict — and §2.7 for the
"AFTER THE PHYSICAL RUN" task's re-derivation against real graded pitch
data, which corrects the REASON the vertical half fails below (availability,
not magnitude) without changing the resolvable/not-resolvable calls
themselves. In summary form against each named layout:

- **Halves (left/right)** — resolvable. Yaw only; comfortably clears its bar.
- **Quadrants (2×2)** — not resolvable as a 4-way attribution. The horizontal half of
  the discrimination is fine; the vertical half fails outright.
- **3×3 grid** — not resolvable as a 9-way attribution, for the same reason: its
  vertical component fails even more severely relative to its own (smaller) required
  gap than the quadrant layout's does.
- **A bare top/bottom split** — not resolvable, at any granularity. This is the
  coarsest possible vertical layout and it still fails by a factor of 2.

**What survives:** a coarse horizontal attribution (defensibly 2-way; plausibly 3-way
— `orientation_trials.jsonl`'s three real, qualitatively distinct readings for
`look_at_screen`/`look_left`/`look_right` are suggestive of a usable 3-way split,
though this has not been directly tested at 3-way resolution, only observed as three
separately-commanded 2-way comparisons). The existing binary "oriented toward screen"
scalar (V_so) and its lateral gaze-direction label are both already built and both
supported by real yaw-driven data. **Neither is validated to the client's own D8
statistical standard** (primary statistic, null distribution, minimum effect, N —
all proposed in the sign-off response's §4.14, none run — see
`docs/MATRIX_ROW_MAP.md` row 14); this document establishes physical *capability*, not
statistical *validation*. Head-gaze coherence as a scalar (rather than per-ROI) is
plausible on the same yaw-driven grounds, but no code computes it today (§1.2) — it
would need to be built, and Task 3 covers what of that is buildable now.

**The caveat that bounds even the surviving claim:** `compute_v_so`'s `oriented`
boolean is `max(yaw_frac, pitch_frac) < threshold` — a single scalar blending both
axes. Because pitch essentially never registers, **a person looking down will read as
"oriented"** regardless of how far down they are actually looking, for exactly the
reason established above. This is not a new finding — CLAUDE.md's own
"Attention / screen-orientation" section already states it — but it directly caps how
much the surviving claim can be trusted for its single most likely real use (detecting
disengagement, whose most common form is looking down at a phone or lap).

### 2.6 Sample size behind the pitch finding — stated explicitly (Task 1.4)

**n = 1 subject, 3 real directed capture sessions, 18 total records**
(`logs/orientation_trials.jsonl`: session IDs `ddbc2c0f…`, `1fd37ee4…`,
`ad539d4a…`, participant codes `TEST`/`TEST1`/`TEST2`, 6 fixed segments per
session — `look_at_screen`, `look_left`, `look_right`, `look_down`, `look_up`,
`look_away_and_back` — verified this session by reading every record's
`session_id`/`participant_code`/`commanded_label`; no distinct-subject
identifier beyond these three test-run labels exists in the data, and nothing
in this repository indicates they are different people). Plus two additional
archived clips analysed in `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` (`test_clip.mp4`,
`directed_clip.mp4`) whose subject identity was never recorded and cannot now
be verified (both files no longer exist on this machine — confirmed again this
session).

**This is pilot-scale, single-subject evidence. It is not a validated,
cross-person finding, and this document does not claim it is one.** The
*mechanism* proposed to explain the pitch finding — face foreshortening during
a downward head tilt degrading the landmark data pitch depends on — is
structural (a property of single-camera 2D landmark geometry under rotation,
not of one person's particular face) and there is a real reason to expect it to
generalise across people. **But "should generalise" is an argument from
mechanism, not a measurement, and this document says which is which rather than
letting the two blend together:** the *argument* is structural and plausible;
the *measurement* is n=1. Per this task's own instruction, the verdict is
**not** softened to compensate for the small n (the pitch finding is reported
as reproducing cleanly across all 3 available sessions and both archived clips
with zero exceptions — a real, consistent pattern within the data that exists),
and the n is **not** overstated to strengthen it (three sessions from what
appears to be one subject is not cross-person validation, and nothing here
claims it clears the client's own D8 statistical standard — see §2.5 above and
`docs/MATRIX_ROW_MAP.md` row 14). Cross-person confirmation remains a real,
open, physical-run item (`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "needs a physical run"
group) — not something this document can supply by more careful re-reading of
the same 18 records.

### 2.7 Re-derivation against the real graded pitch data ("AFTER THE
### PHYSICAL RUN" task, Task 2)

The vertical verdict has moved twice already (§2's own RETRACTION section):
first a magnitude ceiling, then a directed-reliability problem. Real graded
pitch data now exists (`logs/orientation_trials.jsonl`, schema 1.1, labels
`look_down_small_1`, `look_down_medium_1`/`_2`, `look_down_maximal_1`/`_2` —
full numbers in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "Directed pitch capture" entry).
This section re-derives the verdict from those numbers rather than arguing
from the prior framing a third time.

#### 2.7.1 Magnitude, re-derived — required vs. achieved, by commanded intensity

Required separations are unchanged from §2.1 (halves/quadrants yaw 15.53°,
quadrants/top-bottom pitch 8.84°, 3×3 yaw 10.30°/pitch 5.88°). The resting
noise-floor denominator for pitch is **still a genuine data gap** — checked
again this task, not assumed: `logs/null_input_06e8d2be…jsonl` (the real
10-minute quiet-sitting run, §3 below) logs `yaw_deg` per sample but no
pitch field at all, and `graded_pitch_capture.py` never ran a
`look_at_screen` resting phase this task (only directed look-down/look-left/
look-right phases). No real archived pitch-at-rest figure exists anywhere in
this repository, before or after this task — stated plainly rather than
filled with an invented number (G2/G3).

What DOES now exist is a real, graded, independently-judged
directed-effort-max figure, at three commanded intensities:

| Commanded intensity | Real attempt(s) | Achieved pitch (avg / max magnitude) | Required (Quadrants/top-bottom, 8.84°) | Required (3×3, 5.88°) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small (slight glance) | 1 attempt, n=1 sample | 5.66° (single reading — not a real distribution) | ratio 1.56× — **unfavourable** | ratio 1.04× — **unfavourable** |
| Medium (moderate tilt) | 2 attempts | 2.24° avg / 3.00° avg (max 5.58°/11.6°) | ratio 2.95–3.94× — **unfavourable** | ratio 1.96–2.62× — **unfavourable** |
| Maximal (chin-to-chest) | 2 attempts, both independently judged "genuine maximal" | 31.6° avg / 15.2° avg (max 43.1°/23.6°) | ratio 0.28–0.58× (max: 0.21–0.38×) — **favourable** | ratio 0.19–0.39× (max: 0.14–0.25×) — **favourable** |

**Reading this table plainly, in both directions, is the whole point of
re-deriving it rather than re-asserting a verdict:** the old ≤4.4°
directed-effort figure that drove the "magnitude ceiling" and later
"directed-reliability" framings is dead — a real, independently-judged
maximal attempt clears every required separation, at every layout, by a
comfortable margin, using EITHER of the two maximal repetitions on its own.
**But magnitude is only solved at maximal commanded effort.** At medium and
small intensity — arguably closer to how a person actually glances down at
a phone or lap than a deliberate chin-to-chest tuck — the required
separation still exceeds what was achieved, at every layout including the
coarsest (top/bottom). This is a real, asymmetric finding: the channel CAN
carry the required discrimination, but only under an instructed maximal
effort unlikely to represent ordinary disengagement behaviour. Both halves
of that sentence are load-bearing; neither should be dropped to make the
finding cleaner than it is.

#### 2.7.2 Detection rate — the number this task's own instruction expected to dominate

During the same look-down attempts, the fraction of samples that produced
ANY reading at all (`n_detected / n_samples`, as directly logged) was:

| Attempt | Detection rate |
|---|---|
| small | 1/1282 = 0.08% |
| medium 1 | 124/1129 = 10.98% |
| medium 2 | 224/1144 = 19.58% |
| maximal 1 | 182/663 = 27.45% |
| maximal 2 | 94/749 = 12.55% |

**A real methodological caveat, found this task by reading
`orientation_capture.py`'s `record_segment()` directly rather than assumed:
`n_samples` counts PROCESSING-LOOP CYCLES, not unique camera frames.** The
recording loop polls the shared single-slot frame buffer (`s1.latest_frame`)
as fast as the CPU allows, re-running full face detection on whatever frame
is currently buffered — including the SAME frame more than once if T1
(camera capture, nominally ~27–30fps per `logs/soak_log.jsonl`) hasn't
delivered a new one yet. The implied per-second cycle rates in this data
(67–128 cycles/sec, computed as `n_samples / 10s`) are well above the
camera's own real delivery rate, confirming this is really happening, not a
theoretical concern. **This means the detection-rate percentages above are
a real, directly-measured property of what this script's processing loop
actually returned, but they are NOT a directly interpretable "fraction of
real time with a usable reading"** — a run of several cycles in a row
re-detecting (or re-failing to detect) the identical stale frame would
inflate both the numerator and denominator by the same repeated event,
without a documented way to separate genuine per-frame detection from
repeated re-processing of one frame from the data actually logged (no
frame-identity or frame-timestamp field was captured to allow a clean
correction). **This document does not compute a "corrected" percentage** —
doing so would require an assumption about camera delivery rate during
this exact run that isn't independently verified from this run's own data,
and G2/G3 both weigh against presenting an invented correction as if
measured. What IS solid: `look_left_control_2` (the yaw positive control,
same script, same loop) shows a 57.8% raw detection rate — well above every
look-down figure, including maximal — so whatever the loop's re-polling
behaviour contributes to these percentages, it does not erase the real,
large gap between yaw's and pitch's detection rates; the qualitative
finding (pitch's usable-reading fraction is low, and lower than yaw's own,
even under the same measurement artefact) survives the caveat even though
the exact percentages should not be read as literal wall-clock fractions.

**What this means for attribution, stated at the level of confidence the
data supports:** even setting the process-cycle caveat aside entirely and
taking the raw percentages at face value, the BEST observed detection rate
during any look-down attempt (27.45%, maximal 1) means roughly three
readings out of every four processing cycles produced nothing — during a
genuinely, independently-confirmed maximal effort, the most favourable
condition tested. A system attempting continuous per-frame or even
per-window-majority vertical attribution would frequently have no reading
to attribute at all, regardless of how good the reading is when one exists.
This is a different, and by this task's own read of the data, now a
LARGER practical obstacle than magnitude, which §2.7.1 shows is solved at
maximal effort.

#### 2.7.3 Consistency — real, secondary

The two maximal attempts were judged, independently and in real time,
"same effort... genuine maximal" both times, yet produced avg magnitudes of
−31.6° and −15.2° (≈2.0× apart) and maxes of −43.1° and −23.6° (≈1.8× apart).
This is real evidence the ESTIMATOR is inconsistent even when it does
register a large value, not evidence of inconsistent subject effort (the
judgement, collected before either number was shown, treated both as
equally genuine). It bears on how much confidence to place in any single
reading that DOES come through, but — unlike availability — it does not by
itself prevent attribution outright: an inconsistent-but-present large
negative reading is still informative in a coarse, binary sense (something
large happened), just not in a way that would support a precise magnitude-
based multi-way split.

#### 2.7.4 The verdict, restated against the three candidate grounds

This task's own framing proposed testing, not adopting, a specific
expectation: that the verdict now rests on availability and partly
consistency, with magnitude no longer the operative constraint. **The data
supports that expectation, with one real qualification the framing did not
anticipate:**

- **Magnitude: SOLVED at maximal commanded effort, NOT solved at ordinary
  (small/medium) commanded effort** (§2.7.1). This is not a clean "no longer
  a constraint" — it is intensity-dependent, and most real disengagement is
  plausibly closer to "ordinary" than "maximal chin-to-chest."
- **Availability: now the dominant, practically decisive constraint**
  (§2.7.2) — even at the single most favourable condition tested (maximal
  effort), roughly three in four processing cycles produced no reading at
  all. This holds under the raw, directly-logged numbers even before
  considering whether the process-cycle caveat would move the true figure
  up or down.
- **Consistency: real and secondary** (§2.7.3) — a genuine estimator-level
  finding, but one that degrades confidence in a present reading rather
  than preventing attribution the way total absence of a reading does.

**Has the verdict flipped? No — stated directly, not softened.** Vertical
ROI attribution is still not deliverable, at any tested granularity
including the coarsest possible (top/bottom) split. What has changed, for
the second time, is the REASON: not a magnitude ceiling (retracted, §2 top),
not a blanket "large values never show up" directed-reliability failure
(also now shown incomplete — they DO show up under maximal effort), but an
**availability problem, compounded by a real magnitude gap at ordinary
(non-maximal) commanded intensity and a secondary estimator-consistency
problem**. The practical answer this engagement has stated since the first
version of this document — vertical region attribution is not something
this sensing approach can deliver — is unchanged for the third time running,
while its explanation has now moved three times. That instability in the
REASON, not the practical answer, is itself worth naming honestly: it
reflects how little real directed data existed before this task, not
carelessness in any single version of this document.

## 3. What could be built now (Task 3 of the original investigation)

Assuming Obstacle A resolves later and Task 2's verdict constrains what is honest to
compute, against a pluggable synthetic event source — the same pattern
`controls/leakage.py`'s `synthetic_trial_source()` already establishes in this
codebase.

**Update — the ROI dwell/switching/persistence/coverage row below is no longer
speculative.** The "ACT ON THE ROI FEASIBILITY VERDICT" task's own Task 3 built
it: `features.attention.ROIWindowAccumulator`, following
`episodes.WindowAccumulator`'s tumbling-window pattern exactly, tested against a
synthetic `(timestamp, roi_id)` supplier
(`tests/test_roi_aggregation.py::synthetic_roi_source`, mirroring
`controls/leakage.py`'s `synthetic_trial_source()` shape) covering nine
scenarios including all six this task named as a minimum (clean single-region
window, rapid alternation, a window with gaps, a window with no assignments at
all — both "samples present but None" and "add_sample never called" readings of
that phrase — a single assignment spanning the whole window, and a run crossing
a window boundary). See §5 below for what it computes and does not, and
`tests/test_roi_aggregation.py` for the full nine-check proof (all passing).
The table row is left in place, marked done, rather than deleted, so the
document's own history of what was speculative-then-built stays legible.

| Item | What it is | Depends on | How it would be tested now |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Event-log reader / adapter interface** | A function `real_event_source() -> list[trial-like-record]` matching the exact shape `controls/leakage.py`'s `trial_source` contract already expects, plus a mapping into the canonical schema's already-declared `stimulus_id`/`roi_or_condition`/`action_timestamp`/`action_class` fields | The canonical schema (already built) for the *target* shape; nothing for the *source* shape, since that is the harness's own format, unknown until delivered | A hand-built synthetic fixture file standing in for "whatever the harness delivers," exercised through the adapter, asserting the output validates against `schema/canonical_log_v1.json` |
| **Timestamp join between an external stream and our own records** | A pure function taking two wall-clock-anchored monotonic streams (ours + the harness's) and returning aligned pairs, using each side's own `CanonicalLogWriter.open_session()`-style wall-clock/monotonic anchor pair | Nothing external — `time.perf_counter()`/`datetime.now(timezone.utc)` semantics are already fully understood and testable | Two synthetic streams with a known, deliberately-injected clock offset and drift rate; assert the join recovers the known offset within a stated tolerance |
| **ROI dwell / switching / persistence / coverage, computed from *supplied* region assignments** | ✅ BUILT (see update note above, `features.attention.ROIWindowAccumulator`). Given a stream of `(timestamp, roi_id)` tuples — real or synthetic, source-agnostic — compute per-ROI dwell time, switch count, and time-since-last-switch. This is pure aggregation, structurally identical to `episodes.WindowAccumulator`/`attention.AttentionWindowAccumulator`'s existing windowing pattern | Nothing about *our own* gaze-to-ROI attribution accuracy — it aggregates whatever `roi_id` stream it is given, synthetic or real | A synthetic `roi_id` stream with known, hand-constructed dwell/switch patterns; assert the aggregator recovers the known statistics exactly, the same style `tests/test_baselines.py`'s mutation-test pattern already uses |
| **D8's statistic** (oriented-rate difference, salient vs. non-salient episodes) | Pure aggregation math over `(episode_label, oriented_rate)` pairs — the difference statistic, the block-permutation null, the percentile-bootstrap interval, per §4.14 of the response | `simulation/precision.py`'s existing episode-level bootstrap machinery (directly reusable, not reimplemented) | Synthetic episode labels + synthetic oriented-rate values with a known injected effect, mirroring `tests/test_leakage.py`'s injected-severe-leak proof pattern |
| **A_t block placement for any of the above** | ✅ Done for the ROI aggregator (landed inside `features/attention.py`, no new module). Still applies to the two rows below | Nothing beyond what already exists | ✅ Confirmed for the ROI aggregator — `tests/test_feature_separation.py` still passes with it in place |
| **A synthetic ROI-attribution-noise generator** | Extend `simulation/generator.py`'s existing A1–A6 generative model with an "A7"-style mechanism: a true `roi_id` per trial, observed through a configurable attribution-noise parameter (directly analogous to A6's `effect_size` for the candidate signal) | `simulation/generator.py`'s existing structure — this is additive, same shape as every prior extension to that generator | The generator's own existing test pattern (`tests/test_generator.py`) — verify the true-null case (attribution noise = 1) produces chance-level accuracy, and effect_size=0-equivalent produces perfect recovery |
| **ROI-dependent controls, on the synthetic source** | `controls/leakage.py` already accepts any `trial_source`; a synthetic ROI-labelled source (built above) can be plugged in with zero changes to the harness itself | The leakage harness (already built) + the synthetic generator extension above | Already covered by `tests/test_leakage.py`'s existing pluggable-source proof (`check_data_source_is_genuinely_pluggable`) — this would be a second instance of a pattern already demonstrated, not a new capability |

**Constrained by Task 2's verdict, stated plainly:** the dwell/switching/persistence
aggregation math above is honest to build and test against *any* supplied `roi_id`
stream — and, as of this update, has been. It would **not** be honest to wire it to
this system's own attempted gaze-to-ROI attribution beyond a coarse left/right (or
plausibly 3-way) label — doing so for a quadrant- or grid-level attribution would
silently launder Obstacle B's physics problem into what reads as a built, tested
feature. **`ROIWindowAccumulator` was built and tested strictly against the synthetic
supplier for exactly this reason — no camera-derived supplier and no harness adapter
exist anywhere in this module** (per the ACT task's own Task 3.3 instruction). The
aggregation layer and the attribution layer are separable, and were built separably.

### Genuinely cannot be built until real events exist

- **The real harness-format adapter** — its wire format is unknown; nothing to build
  against.
- **Real gaze-to-ROI attribution accuracy, at any resolution** — needs real recorded
  sessions with simultaneous ground-truth ROI and gaze; this is exactly Obstacle A +
  Obstacle B's physical-run dependency, not a code gap.
- **D8's actual minimum-effect size and required trial count** — per the response's
  own §4.14, these are to be *derived from the D6 simulation*, not asserted; deriving
  them needs the harness's real session-length/class-balance numbers (Decision C in
  the response), which do not exist yet.
- **Real clock-drift measurement between two independent processes** — cannot be
  measured without a second real running system; the join *mechanism* (above) is
  buildable, its real-world accuracy is not testable until then.
- **The leakage/time-shuffle controls' real-data run** — already listed as
  outstanding in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`; ROI data does not change this, it only adds
  a new *kind* of trial these same controls could eventually run against.

---

## 4. The separation risk (Task 4)

### 4.1 Every plausible entry route for ROI/gaze-derived information into C_t or E_t

**(a) Direct import.** `features/context.py` (C_t) is currently empty, but nothing
prevents a future implementation from `import`ing `features.attention` directly — the
exact "legal-looking back door" `features/context.py`'s own docstring and
`docs/D1_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md` already name, because `C_t -> E_t` is a *permitted*
direction.

**(b) Shared field name.** If `episodes.WindowAccumulator` (or any future E_t
component) were ever generalised from its current hardcoded composite/covariate key
lists to accept a caller-supplied dict of "extra features," a context-supplied field
that happens to share a name with an attention-block output (`gaze_score`,
`orientation_score`, etc.) could enter E_t without any import at all — purely by
sitting under a familiar-looking key in a dict built elsewhere.

**(c) A record read from a shared log.** Sample records already interleave
attention-block fields (`screen_orientation`, `gaze_direction`, `look_away`) alongside
X_core fields (`vectors`, `vectors_deviation`) in the *same* JSON object, in the *same*
`logs/session_*.jsonl` file (confirmed directly, `docs/LOG_EVIDENCE.md`'s field list).
A future C_t/E_t component that reads "the sample record" generically from this file
— rather than specifically the X_core-relevant sub-fields — could pick up
attention-block content purely because it lives in the same on-disk object, with no
Python-level import anywhere in the chain.

**(d) A join key.** `session_id` and a timestamp are the natural keys for joining any
two record types from the same session. A future E_t-building step that joins "context
for this window" by `session_id` + nearest/overlapping timestamp could inadvertently
match an `attention_window_summary` record — which shares both keys with every other
record type in the same session — under a generic "whatever's relevant to this window"
join, without ever importing `features.attention`.

### 4.2 Would the existing separation test catch each route?

| Route | Caught today? | Why / why not |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Direct import | ✅ **CLOSED** (ACT task, Task 2). `FORBIDDEN_EDGES` in `tests/test_feature_separation.py` now includes `("context","attention")` and `("context","audio")`. Proven non-vacuous, not just added: a temporary `from features.attention import ATTENTION_ORIENTED_SCORE_THRESHOLD` inserted into `features/context.py` made check 1 FAIL with `"context.py imports (transitively) attention.py -- path: context -> attention"`; a temporary `import features.audio` made it FAIL with the matching `context -> audio` message; both were reverted and the suite returned to PASS. **This gap existed and was found by audit (this document's own §4.2, previous revision) rather than by the guard itself — the guard had no entry naming `context` as a source even though `BLOCK_MODULES` already treated it as a graph node. Worth recording plainly: the separation test's own coverage had a real hole for as long as `features/context.py` stayed empty, and closing it took a human noticing, not the test catching itself.** `C_t -> E_t` stays permitted, correctly — neither new edge touches `episodes` or `x_core` as a source; only `context` as a source, into `attention`/`audio`, is now forbidden, matching D1's actual constraint (CLAUDE.md: `A_t -> X_core`/`A_t -> E_t` and `U_t -> X_core`/`U_t -> E_t` forbidden; `C_t -> E_t` permitted) rather than a broader, incorrect rule that would have also blocked the permitted direction. | Previously: extend `FORBIDDEN_EDGES` with two tuples, no new function needed. Now done — see the CLOSED note. |
| (b) Shared field name | **Not caught by anything.** No existing check inspects JSON/dict *key names* in logged output at all — checks 1–4 all operate on Python import/call graphs, never on the shape of a dict a function returns. | **What would be needed**: a test asserting `WindowAccumulator.flush()`'s (and any future E_t component's) output keys are drawn from an explicit, fixed, enumerated set — never dynamically extended from a caller-supplied dict — i.e., a guard on the *discipline* (hardcoded key lists) that already exists today, turned into an explicit, checked invariant rather than an implicit property of the current code. |
| (c) Record read from a shared log | **Not caught by anything.** This is a runtime, file-format data-flow risk, invisible to any static Python-level analysis — none of the four checks read a `.jsonl` file or reason about record types at all. | **What would be needed**: extend the check-3 philosophy (poison a module, prove real code never touches it) from in-process poisoning to log-schema poisoning — a fixture log file containing *only* attention-block record types (`attention_window_summary`, samples with only attention fields populated) fed to whatever future C_t/E_t log-reading code exists, asserting it returns nothing usable (raises, or returns an empty/filtered result) rather than silently accepting attention-typed content. |
| (d) Join key | **Not caught by anything**, for the same reason as (c) — a data-flow risk outside any existing check's scope. | **What would be needed**: once real join logic exists, a test that constructs a log containing *only* `attention_window_summary` records for a given `session_id`/time range and asserts a "join context for this window" function returns empty rather than silently substituting the attention record under a generic key. |

**Summary**: routes (b), (c), and (d) share a common shape — every one of them is a
*data-flow* risk (through a dict, a file, or a join), not an *import-graph* risk, and
none of the four existing checks look at data flow at all; all four were built,
correctly, to answer "did forbidden code get imported or called," not "did a
forbidden-shaped value arrive some other way." **Route (a) is now closed** (see the
row above) — the graph-based machinery already existed and already handled `context`
as a node; the missing piece was the two `FORBIDDEN_EDGES` entries, now added and
proven to fail-then-pass. Routes (b)/(c)/(d) remain open, and remain **not urgent
while `features/context.py` stays empty** (confirmed, again, this session: zero
functions, classes, or constants in the file). They become urgent the day someone
starts filling C_t in — which is exactly what `features/context.py`'s own docstring
already says, and this task's own findings do not change that timing, only sharpen
what the guard would need to check when the day comes.

## 5. What remains blocked, and why (Task 4 of the "ACT ON THE ROI FEASIBILITY
## VERDICT" task)

This investigation produced one distinction that must not be lost by a later
document collapsing it back into a single "ROI/attention status": **what this
system computes ABOUT a supplied assignment is a completely different question
from what this system can DETERMINE about gaze on its own**, and the two now
have different, independently-stated statuses.

### 5.1 ROI derivatives from a supplied assignment stream — BUILT, blocked only on the harness

`features.attention.ROIWindowAccumulator` computes dwell, switching, per-ROI
persistence (with left/right window-boundary censoring flagged), and coverage
from a caller-supplied `(timestamp, roi_id)` stream. **This is unaffected by
the resolution verdict in §2** — it performs no gaze-to-ROI inference of its
own; `roi_id` is handed to it, opaque, from wherever the caller obtained it.
Tested against a synthetic supplier (`tests/test_roi_aggregation.py`, 9/9
checks passing, covering clean single-region, rapid alternation, gaps, no
assignments at all, a single assignment spanning the whole window, and a run
crossing a window boundary — see that file for the exact boundary-crossing
behaviour chosen and why). Confirmed, by `tests/test_feature_separation.py`,
unable to reach `X_core` or `E_t`. **This is blocked only on the client's task
harness supplying the stream — integration work, not construction.** No
camera-derived supplier and no harness adapter exist, deliberately (the
harness's real event format is unknown; building one now would be exactly the
placeholder definition this engagement has repeatedly forbidden).

### 5.2 Gaze-to-ROI attribution from our own sensor — constrained by the resolution verdict

This is the question §2 actually answers, and the answer did not change with
this update, only its precision improved (§2.4). Using the Task 1 table:

- **Halves (left/right, 1×2)** — survives. Yaw-only; required separation
  clears its noise floor by ≈24× and sits at roughly a fifth of the max
  natural yaw excursion observed in archived footage.
- **Quadrants (2×2)** — does not survive as a 4-way attribution. Its
  horizontal half is fine (same yaw margin as halves); its vertical half
  fails under the directed-effort comparison (≈2.0×, required exceeds
  achievable) even though it would numerically clear under the
  natural-movement-max comparison — see §2.4 for why the directed-effort
  reading governs here.
- **3×3 grid** — does not survive as a 9-way attribution, for the same
  reason, more severely (its vertical requirement is smaller, but so is
  what's achievable relative to it).
- **A bare top/bottom split (the coarsest possible vertical layout)** — does
  not survive either. This is the finding that rules out routing around the
  problem with a coarser layout: even the coarsest possible vertical split
  fails the directed-effort comparison by the same ≈2.0× margin as the
  quadrant layout's vertical half.

**Nothing here is blocked on the harness.** This question is answerable from
data already in this repository (§2), and the answer is: horizontal
attribution is buildable and defensible (coarse 2-way, plausibly 3-way);
vertical attribution is not, at any tested granularity — established and
reproduced from two independent sources (§2.2), regardless of which of the
three candidate mechanisms turns out to be responsible for it (§2.4a).

### 5.3 Head-gaze coherence — deliverable only in a horizontal-only form

No code computes head-gaze coherence anywhere in this repository today (§1.2).
Whether it is deliverable at all depends on both its terms, and one of
them — the vertical/pitch component — is exactly what §2 shows is not
resolvable. **Stated plainly: a full (horizontal + vertical) head-gaze
coherence measure is not honestly buildable from this pipeline's current
sensing, for the same reason vertical ROI attribution is not.** A
**horizontal-only** form is deliverable: comparing head yaw's lateral
direction/orientation against gaze's own coarse LEFT/RIGHT/CENTER label
(`compute_gaze_direction`, already built, §1.2), both already shown reliable
under direction (§2.2's yaw evidence). What that horizontal-only form WOULD
tell you: whether head orientation and eye direction agree or disagree on
which SIDE of the screen a person is oriented toward — a real, yaw-driven
signal. What it would NOT tell you: anything about vertical coherence (a
person's head level but eyes cast down, or vice versa) — the single most
common form of a person disengaging while still facing a screen. Presenting a
horizontal-only coherence measure as "head-gaze coherence" without that
caveat would overclaim in exactly the way CLAUDE.md's own
"Attention / screen-orientation" section already warns against for V_so
itself. Not built in this task — a real, honest scope statement of what a
future build should say it is and is not, kept separate from the buildable-now
work in §5.1 so a later document cannot accidentally promise the vertical half
by conflating the two.

**Why these three stay visibly separate:** collapsing 5.1 into "ROI is built"
would overclaim readiness on 5.2's still-blocked half; collapsing 5.2's
verdict into 5.1's would make the harness look like the only remaining
blocker, when the sensor itself is a second, independent limit that arriving
harness data cannot remove. Keeping them apart is the only way this document
avoids promising in September what the sensor cannot do in October.

---

## 6. The capture that would settle the mechanism (Task 3, "PITCH: SEPARATE
## THE FINDING FROM ITS EXPLANATION")

**Specification only — not built.** This is a named outstanding item, added
to `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "needs a physical run" group (§4.2 of that
task). It requires one person with a webcam; it cannot be run in this coding
environment (no live camera, no human operator). It is designed specifically
to separate M1/M2/M3 (§2.4a) — nothing about ROI attribution's viability is
expected to change as a result (§2.4a's practical verdict already holds under
all three), but which mechanism is responsible determines whether the
limitation is permanent or addressable by different sensing later.

### 6.1 What each required element is for

- **Raw per-frame yaw AND pitch, in degrees, logged — not just the derived
  binary or rate.** This is the element `orientation_trials.jsonl` (schema
  1.0) is missing entirely (§2.4a). Note this is PARTIALLY already built:
  `orientation_capture.py`'s current code (schema 1.1) already aggregates raw
  yaw/pitch/roll per segment (avg/min/max/variance, `_raw_angle_stats`) — but
  never per-frame, and never run (zero schema-1.1 records exist). A genuinely
  settling capture needs the full per-frame series (timestamp + raw yaw +
  raw pitch, every sample), not just the segment-level aggregate, so a raw
  reading can be correlated in time against the independent ground truth
  below — a segment-level max can tell you a large value occurred SOMEWHERE
  in the window, but not whether it occurred DURING the operator-confirmed
  hold or during the return-to-center movement either side of it.
- **Independent ground truth of whether the head actually moved, from the
  frames themselves, not from the estimator being tested.** This is the
  single element missing from every existing artefact examined in §2.4a,
  including `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md`'s own frame-by-frame scan (which re-examined
  the SAME estimator's output, not an independent signal). Without it, no
  future re-analysis of estimator output alone — however careful — can ever
  separate M1 from M2, because both mechanisms produce identical estimator
  output by construction (a small reported pitch value, whether or not a
  large real movement occurred). Two independently-workable options,
  detailed in §6.2.
- **Directed phases with enough repetitions to say something about
  reliability, not one attempt.** A single "look down" trial, pass or fail,
  cannot distinguish "this person, this one time, didn't try hard enough"
  (a single M1 data point) from "this consistently fails across repeated,
  independently-confirmed genuine attempts" (evidence against M1, toward
  M2/M3). Repetition is what turns one anecdote into a reliability estimate.
- **The sub-threshold question addressed — log the continuous value so M3
  can be ruled in or out separately from M2.** A binary "detected the
  movement / did not" would leave M2 and M3 conflated: a real 12° movement
  discarded by the 20° threshold (M3) and a real 25° movement the estimator
  reports as 2° (M2) look identical if only the thresholded outcome is kept.
  Logging the continuous raw value (already covered by the first element
  above) is what makes this separable — read the raw value directly against
  the threshold rather than only the post-threshold boolean/rate.

### 6.2 The independent-ground-truth mechanism, in detail

Two workable options, either sufficient on its own; a single-operator solo
session can only use the first:

1. **Live operator, blind to the number.** A second person watches the
   subject's actual head position during each hold and records a simple
   categorical judgement per repetition — "clearly performed the commanded
   movement" / "partial" / "did not perform it" — **without looking at the
   live pitch readout while making that judgement**, so the judgement is not
   contaminated by the instrument under test. This mirrors the existing
   Decision-45 pattern (an operator watching live during calibration) already
   used elsewhere in this codebase, applied here to a judgement the operator
   has never been asked to make before (this signal has never had operator
   oversight — `PITCH_DIAGNOSTIC.md` §3 confirms the operator overlay
   doesn't even display pitch).
2. **Recorded video of the subject, reviewed frame-by-frame after capture,
   blind to the logged numbers.** For a genuinely solo session. **G4
   applies in full**: video of a real person's face is exactly the raw,
   identifying data this repository must never commit — any video recorded
   for this purpose stays entirely OUTSIDE the repository, on the operator's
   own device, for the duration of the review only; only the DERIVED
   per-repetition judgement labels (not the video itself) are ever logged
   into the JSONL record. This is the same constraint that already ruled out
   re-scanning `test_clip.mp4`/`directed_clip.mp4` earlier in this
   investigation (§2.2) — the video existed once, was analysed, and was
   never committed; this protocol should follow the same discipline from the
   start rather than needing it enforced after the fact.

### 6.3 Protocol outline (specification, not a build)

| Phase | Content | Purpose | Approx. time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup | Consent, camera check, brief explanation of what will be asked | Standard | ~5 min |
| Baseline | `look_at_screen`, held ~10s, once | Fills the pitch noise-floor gap §2.3/§2.4 already flags as missing — this protocol should log it even though it isn't the primary target | ~1 min |
| Yaw positive control | `look_left`/`look_right`, 3 reps each, ~10s hold + ~5s return between reps | A sanity check that the protocol and operator/reviewer process itself works, using the direction already known to register reliably (§2.2) — if yaw doesn't show its known-reliable pattern under this NEW protocol, the protocol itself is suspect, not just pitch | ~1.5 min |
| Pitch — graded intensity | `look_down` at three instructed intensities (slight / moderate / maximal), 3 reps each, same hold/return timing | Directly targets M3: a "slight" or "moderate" instructed attempt that stays sub-threshold but is still operator/reviewer-confirmed as a real, deliberate movement is exactly the case that would let sub-threshold real movement be seen and ruled in or out, separately from a wholesale failure to move at all | ~2.5 min |
| Pitch — maximal, repeated | `look_down`, 5 reps at maximal instructed effort; `look_up`, 5 reps (lower priority — §2.2's `look_up` figures were already less extreme than `look_down`'s) | The reliability question itself: does a REPEATEDLY, INDEPENDENTLY-CONFIRMED genuine maximal attempt fail to register every time (evidence against M1, toward M2), or does it fail unevenly / does the operator/reviewer judge some attempts as not genuinely maximal (evidence for M1)? | ~3.5 min |
| Wrap-up | Debrief, confirm video (if used) will not be committed, delete/move per G4 | Standard | ~2 min |

**Estimated total run time: 15–20 minutes per subject**, single session,
one person with a webcam plus (for the highest-confidence version) a second
person as live operator, or a solo session with post-hoc video review kept
outside the repository. Repeating this across the same cross-person set
already needed for other pending validation work (Gate-2-style, ≥8 people)
would additionally start supplying the cross-person confirmation §2.6
identifies as still missing for the underlying pitch finding itself — a
second, separate benefit of the same capture, not required for THIS
mechanism question but worth noting since the same protocol would serve both.

### 6.4 What a result would indicate for each mechanism

- **Favours M1**: the operator/reviewer judgement itself frequently records
  "partial" or "did not perform it" for nominally-maximal attempts — i.e.,
  subjects, even when told to look down as far as possible, often visibly do
  not, across repeated independent attempts.
- **Favours M2**: the operator/reviewer judgement confirms a genuine,
  sustained, maximal downward tilt on most or all repetitions, while the
  simultaneously-logged raw pitch value stays low (well under the 20°
  threshold, ideally under the ≤4.4° range already seen) during the
  confirmed-genuine hold specifically.
- **Favours M3**: the graded-intensity phase shows raw pitch values that are
  real and non-trivial (say, 10–19°) during confirmed genuine "slight" or
  "moderate" attempts, staying just under the 20° threshold — i.e., the
  estimator IS registering real movement, just not enough to cross the
  current threshold, which would separately raise the question of whether
  `ATTENTION_PITCH_THRESHOLD_DEG` itself (not the estimator) is the limiting
  factor.
- A genuine mixture (some subjects/attempts each mechanism) is also a
  legitimate, reportable outcome — this protocol is not designed to force a
  single clean answer, only to make each mechanism's signature visible if
  present.
