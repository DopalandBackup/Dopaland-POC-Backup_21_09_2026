"""
D0PA1 control -- POSITIVE BLINK CONTROL HARNESS.

Compares features.attention.BlinkDetector's output against a manual,
frame-by-frame blink count over N one-minute clips. G1: this harness
computes and reports numbers (event precision/recall/F1, per-clip count
Bland-Altman). It NEVER compares a computed value to a criterion and
NEVER returns a pass/fail -- see BlinkPositiveConfig's own docstring for
where the client-accepted criterion values (D0PA1_Client_SignOff_001.md
§3) live and why they are never read back by any function in this file.

3.4 -- SCOPE LIMIT, stated here and repeated in docs/CONTROLS.md: this
validates blink-count DETECTION only. It establishes no psychological
interpretation of blinking (fatigue, attention, affect, anything else). A
detector that reliably counts blinks the way a human would is a
DETECTION-validation result; it is not, and is never presented as,
construct validation of what blinking MEANS.

3.3 -- THE CLIPS DO NOT EXIST YET. Every function below is exercised in
tests/test_blink_positive.py against SYNTHETIC aperture streams with
KNOWN ground-truth blink timestamps -- never a real clip. No placeholder
"result" for a real clip is generated anywhere in this file or committed
to this repository. See docs/CONTROLS.md section 4 for the explicit
statement that no real clips have been processed.

REUSES, not reimplemented:
  - features.attention.BlinkDetector -- the actual detector under test,
    imported and run unmodified (G5: this harness observes it, never
    patches its thresholds).
  - analysis.reliability.compute_bland_altman_pair /
    plot_bland_altman_svg -- per-clip count agreement (3.1's "Bland-Altman
    on the paired counts") is built by treating "detected count" and
    "manual count" as two columns of a (n_clips, 2) matrix and calling the
    SAME Bland-Altman function analysis/reliability.py already has and
    tests, rather than a third implementation of limits-of-agreement math.

# back to make a comparison -- grep this file: there is no
