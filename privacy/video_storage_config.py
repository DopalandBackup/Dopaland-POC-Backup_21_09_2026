"""
D0PA1 raw video storage location.

Mirrors `privacy/audio_storage_config.py`'s pattern exactly, for the other
raw-media modality. Until this task, no raw-video storage location had ever
been decided anywhere in this repository -- `docs/PRIVACY_AND_RETENTION.md`
named that gap explicitly and proposed, but did not implement, a UNIFIED
raw-media-root variable covering both modalities.

`D0PA1_Client_SignOff_001.md` §5.2 (2026-09-18) decides the POLICY -- raw
media (video, and audio if any is recorded) lives in a defined folder
OUTSIDE `C:\\Dopaland-POC` for the 90-day retention period (§5.1) -- without
deciding the unification question, which §6 of that same record explicitly
lists as still open. This module therefore implements the video side with
its OWN environment variable, matching audio's already-stricter pattern
(no literal default, raises loudly if unset), rather than pre-empting the
unified-root proposal `docs/PRIVACY_AND_RETENTION.md` describes as
"proposed, not implemented, not decided." If a unified root is decided
later, this module and `audio_storage_config.py` both get superseded
together, not one without the other.

The operator is expected to set `D0PA1_VIDEO_RAW_STORAGE_LOCATION` to a
real directory OUTSIDE this repository before any code that would write
raw video runs. This module does not create, validate, or write to that
directory -- it only resolves and hashes the configuration.
