"""
D6 precision simulation, Part A -- synthetic trial-sequence generator.

Produces a single subject's synthetic session -> episode -> trial hierarchy,
so that resampling downstream (simulation/precision.py) can operate at the
episode level, per CLAUDE.md's D0PA1 hard constraint #4 ("resample at
episode/session/day level, never bootstrap frames or individual trials as
if independent").

This module NEVER touches real action data, never imports from features/,
and never modifies anything on the validated path (G5). It is a standalone,
fully synthetic generator built so the same code can later be reused for
synthetic latent recovery (D6's second deliverable).

GENERATIVE MODEL, ONE PARAGRAPH: a single continuous latent state z_t
follows an AR(1) process, restarted fresh each session (A1). The action
class at each trial is drawn from a softmax whose logits combine a slowly
drifting base rate (A4) with a contribution from z_t whose strength grows
across the study as the subject "learns" the task (A2) and whose underlying
noise inflates within a session as the subject "fatigues" (A3). The
candidate representation under test -- the synthetic stand-in for a
signal like V_es or V_pd -- is an observation of z_t corrupted by noise at
a configurable strength (A6): effect_size=0 means the candidate signal
carries NO information about the action class (a true null); effect_size
near 1 means it is nearly a direct read of the state that drives the class.
Missingness is a bursty two-state Markov chain (A5), not IID coin flips, so
that a tracking-loss run lasting several consecutive trials is represented
correctly rather than being smoothed away by independent per-trial dropout.

Every numeric default below is an INVENTED assumption (no real data exists
yet to inform it) and is listed, with justification, in
docs/D6_SIMULATION.md. Nothing here is tuned to make any result look better
(G2) -- these are the assumptions BEFORE any output was inspected.
