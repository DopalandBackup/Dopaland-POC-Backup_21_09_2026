"""
D6 precision simulation, Part B -- fit, evaluate, bootstrap, sweep.

G1 discipline: every function here COMPUTES AND STORES A NUMBER. None of
them compare that number to a threshold, decide RETAIN/DROP/INCONCLUSIVE,
or recommend a delta value. The primary metric (macro_f1 by default) and
any delta value are left as PARAMETERS/plain outputs for a human to read
and compare -- see B5.

Standalone; does not import from features/ and does not touch the
validated pipeline (G5).

NEGATIVE CONTROL, WIRED IN AUTOMATICALLY (D0PA1 Part 2.2): compute_delta()
below ALWAYS builds a third comparison -- baseline + a deliberately
meaningless negative-control signal (controls/negative_control.py) vs
baseline alone -- alongside the real candidate signal's with/without
comparison. There is NO flag to disable this; every DeltaResult and every
run_one/run_one_refit/sweep* row carries delta_negative_control next to
delta_point, so a negative control can never be skipped by forgetting an
optional argument in a test where it would be inconvenient. It decides
nothing (G1): a large delta_negative_control is reported for a human to
investigate, never auto-flagged as a kill condition -- see
controls/negative_control.py and docs/CONTROLS.md.

# above resamples the TEST set's evaluation against a single, fixed fitted
# model -- disclosed in docs/D6_SIMULATION.md as understating true CI width,
# because it captures only "how much would Delta move under a different
# draw of test episodes", not "how much would Delta move under a different
# draw of TRAINING episodes, which would have fit a different model."
#
# This function fixes that with a DOUBLE bootstrap: for every replicate, it
# (a) resamples TRAINING episodes (or sessions) WITH REPLACEMENT and REFITS
# both models from scratch on that resampled training set, AND (b)
# independently resamples TEST episodes WITH REPLACEMENT and evaluates the
# freshly refit models on that resampled test set. Both sources of
# variability are captured together in the same replicate.
#
# THIS MATTERS AND WAS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED: an earlier version of this
# function resampled train (and refit) while holding the test set FIXED --
# that captures ONLY train-refit variability and OMITS test-resampling
# variability entirely; it is not "Pass 1's method plus more", it is a
# DIFFERENT, narrower quantity that happened to produce a SMALLER CI than
# Pass 1's fixed-model bootstrap on the same data (0.0088 vs 0.0113),
# which is the wrong direction given Pass 1's own disclosed concern.
# Resampling both train and test together is what actually captures MORE
# of the true uncertainty than Pass 1's method, not less -- see
# docs/D6_SIMULATION.md's Pass 2 section for the full account of this,
# including the numbers from the version that had to be corrected.
#
# COST-SAVING SIMPLIFICATIONS (disclosed, not hidden -- see
# docs/D6_SIMULATION.md Pass 2 section):
#   - L2 for both models is FIXED at the value chosen once on the real
#     (non-resampled) train/val split, not re-selected via the L2_GRID
#     search on every replicate. Re-selecting would multiply cost ~3x for
#     a source of variability (regularization-strength uncertainty) this
#     correction is not targeting.
#   - The signal imputation mean is likewise fixed at the real train
#     split's value, not recomputed per replicate.
#   - n_boot is far smaller than bootstrap_ci_on_delta's default (Pass 1
#     used 800; Pass 2's refit variant uses far fewer -- see the calling
#     code for the exact number and the profiled reason) because a full
#     refit is ~1-2 orders of magnitude more expensive per replicate than
#     re-evaluating a fixed model. This is REPORTED, not absorbed: fewer
#     replicates means a noisier CI estimate, and that tradeoff is stated
#     plainly everywhere this function's output is used.

# genuinely weak or null can produce IDENTICAL predictions between the

# at effect_size=0.0, both models collapsed to predicting the majority
# class on every test trial, giving delta_point EXACTLY 0.0 with an EXACT
# zero-width bootstrap CI on that one draw -- not a bug, a real property
# of comparing hard decisions rather than continuous scores). Reporting a
# single such draw's zero-width CI as "this N resolves arbitrarily small
# deltas" would be actively misleading in the opposite direction from the

# the TYPICAL precision achievable at a given N, not one lucky (or
