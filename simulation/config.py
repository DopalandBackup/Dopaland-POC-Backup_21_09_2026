D0PA1 pre-registered configuration (D6 Addendum 3; generalised, Gate 0 A2).

Originally the minimal versioned home for exactly one pre-registered
parameter (log_loss_clip_eps). Gate 0's A2 step generalises this into the
real provenance layer CLAUDE.md's "WHAT D0PA1 ADDS" section describes --
but generalising the CONTAINER does not mean every hardcoded constant in
the repository belongs inside it. Every field added here still has to meet
the same bar the original docstring set: a quantity whose VALUE materially
changes what a downstream metric or record reports, fixed in advance rather
than tunable after seeing a result (G2). See docs/GATE0_PROVENANCE.md
section A2 for the full audit of which hardcoded constants were moved here
and which were deliberately left in place (most of them -- anything
load-bearing inside the validated path, G5, stays exactly where it is;
moving a constant's *definition* is itself a change to a G5-protected file,
independent of whether its numeric value stays the same).

Companion to simulation/provenance.py's RunProvenance: THIS file answers
"which pre-registered parameter values are in force" (fixed once, reused
across many runs); RunProvenance answers "which code, exactly, produced
this run's data" (captured fresh every run). Different lifetimes, kept in
separate objects on purpose -- see provenance.py's own module docstring.
