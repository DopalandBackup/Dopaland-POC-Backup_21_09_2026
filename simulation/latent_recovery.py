D0PA1 -- SYNTHETIC LATENT RECOVERY.

    Z_true -> observation generator -> pipeline -> Z_hat
    recovery_error = d(Z_true, Z_hat)

MUST be runnable BEFORE any latent model touches human data (2.5's
prerequisite, restated as code: this module never imports anything camera-
or feature-derived; it operates entirely on simulation.generator's
synthetic z/x_signal streams).

WHY THIS IS A PREREQUISITE, NOT AN EXTRA (2.5): without this check, a
near-zero measured latent contribution on REAL data is ambiguous between
two completely different explanations -- "the latent state genuinely adds
nothing" (a real, valuable negative result -- one of the outcomes this
study is explicitly designed to be able to report) and "the recovery
implementation is silently broken" (a bug, not a finding). Those two
explanations require completely different responses, and nothing about a
near-zero number on its own tells you which one you're looking at. This
module removes that ambiguity in the one place it CAN be removed -- on
synthetic data where the true latent state is known -- so that a later
near-zero result on real data can be read as a finding about the world
rather than a question about the code.

G1: this module reports two numbers per sweep point (correlation, RMSE).
It sets NO success threshold anywhere. The proposed values (correlation
>= 0.7, standardised RMSE <= 0.5) are NOT implemented here as a
pass/fail -- see run_and_report()'s own docstring. That comparison is for
a human to make, against numbers this module computes and prints.

G2: nothing here is tuned to make the recovery curve look better. The
recovery pipeline (a simple exponential moving average, see
recover_latent_ema()) is the simplest defensible choice consistent with
"simple model families" (the client's own scope constraint, see
simulation/models.py's docstring) -- not a sophisticated filter selected
because it produced a nicer curve.

recover_latent_ema() IS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT THE STUDY'S LATENT MODEL --
that model does not exist yet. It exists solely so the machinery
(correlation/RMSE computation, missing-data handling, the sweep) has
something concrete to recover a KNOWN Z_true from. Every number this
module or docs/D6_SIMULATION.md's section 13 reports characterises THIS
PLACEHOLDER on synthetic data -- never the eventual method, and never
compared against the proposed success values (correlation >= 0.7,
standardised RMSE <= 0.5) anywhere in this codebase.

2.4 -- STATED PLAINLY, HERE AND IN docs/D6_SIMULATION.md's latent-recovery
section: this validates the MACHINERY (does correlation/RMSE computation,
missing-data handling, and a plausible simple recovery procedure behave
correctly on data with a KNOWN generative process) under KNOWN, STATED
assumptions (AR(1) latent state, Gaussian observation noise, the
generator's own A1-A6 model). It establishes NOTHING about whether a
human latent state is psychologically real, or whether this particular
recovery procedure is the right one for real data. That distinction is
CONTRACTUAL, not stylistic -- do not present a result from this module as
evidence about the subject.
