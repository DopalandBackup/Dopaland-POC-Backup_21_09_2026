"""
D6 precision simulation -- concrete sweep grid and report artefacts (Part
B4/B6/C). This is the DRIVER: it calls simulation/generator.py and
simulation/precision.py (which are the reusable, generic pipeline) with a
specific grid of configurations chosen for this report, and writes:

  artefacts/d6_sweep_results.json    -- full per-seed and aggregated results
  artefacts/d6_sweep_n_curve.svg     -- CI half-width vs N, several effect sizes
  artefacts/d6_sweep_effect_size.svg -- CI half-width & delta vs effect size, realistic N
  artefacts/d6_sweep_missingness.svg -- CI half-width vs missingness rate, realistic N

No verdict, no PASS/FAIL, no comparison against any delta value anywhere in
this file (G1) -- artefacts/precision_analysis_v1.md does that comparison,
as arithmetic, for a human to read.

COMMON RANDOM NUMBERS: the SAME set of seeds is reused across every point
within one sweep dimension (e.g., every episodes_per_session value in the
N-curve sweep uses seeds 1..N_SEEDS). This is a standard variance-reduction
technique for simulation studies -- it makes the resulting curve smoother
and more directly comparable point-to-point, because each seed represents
"the same underlying random subject", extended or shortened, rather than an
independent draw at every point.
