Stage 1, steps 4+5, plus Stage 1.5 step 8 — 4 biometric vectors,
geometric, pose-normalized 3D (CLAUDE.md Decision 11 + MANDATORY
ARCHITECTURE #4); the 10s rolling window (avg/peak/variance, MANDATORY
ARCHITECTURE #5) with a window-validity gate; and per-person
within-session neutral calibration (Decision #5 / Pitfall #2 /
MANDATORY ARCHITECTURE #6), built deliberately BEFORE step 6's V/A
mapping so that mapping runs on calibrated (deviation-from-neutral)
vectors from the start, not raw magnitudes that would need redoing.

New file (not an edit of stage0_skeleton.py) so Stage 0's Gate-1 artifact
stays intact and reviewable on its own. Thread 1 (capture) is copied over
unchanged. Thread 2 changes in two ways from Stage 0:

1. Continuous sampling, not a 10s tick (CADENCE clarification — not new
   scope): the "every 10s" rule governs the summary/agent/DB step, which
   doesn't exist until Stage 2. Thread 2 loops at detection speed and
   logs every sample ("log per-frame", Decision 12) — required because
   V_pd is itself defined as a variance over a rolling ~1-2s buffer, and
   step 5's 10s window needs a real sample stream to summarize.
2. RunningMode.VIDEO instead of IMAGE: IMAGE mode has no inter-frame
   tracking, so min_tracking_confidence would be silently meaningless.
   VIDEO mode (detect_for_video, monotonically increasing ms timestamps)
   makes tracking — and therefore that confidence floor — real.

Step 4 validation found our facial vectors (V_bf, V_es) are direction-
reliable but magnitude-noisy under head rotation (io_dist, their shared
scale reference, carries residual yaw correlation ~0.25 at full range).
Step 5's window design leans on this finding rather than re-fighting it:
variance-per-window doubles as the confidence signal (a high-variance
window, e.g. mid head-turn, is a low-trust reading) rather than just a
logged stat — see episodes.WindowAccumulator.

Landmark indices are verified against
mediapipe/python/solutions/face_mesh_connections.py (google-ai-edge/
mediapipe, master), not assumed from memory.

=== D0PA1 BATCH 1 STEP 3 REFACTOR NOTE (feature-block separation) ===
The vector formulas, calibration, windowing, attention signals, and V/A
mapping that used to live in this file have MOVED to features/geometry.py,
features/x_core.py, features/episodes.py, and features/attention.py (D1
feature-block separation, CLAUDE.md). This file is now an ORCHESTRATOR: it
owns the two-thread loop, the webcam, MediaPipe setup, and the live
overlay/plot, and imports the actual feature computation from those
modules. No formula, threshold, or behavior changed in the move (G5) --
see tests/test_refactor_snapshot.py for the byte-exact regression net and
docs/D1_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md for the full picture. The design-rationale prose
below (ATTENTION SIGNAL / PILOT STATUS sections) is retained as accurate
HISTORY of why V_so was built the way it was; the code itself now lives in
features/attention.py.

--- ATTENTION SIGNAL, Step 1 (V_so -- screen orientation) ---
A NEW, FIFTH geometric signal, added after Gate 2, using the exact same
discipline the four affect vectors were built with: reuse the existing
head-pose decomposition (yaw_pitch_roll_from_matrix, already computed
every cycle for the quality gate -- not recomputed here), a first-cut
threshold explicitly derived from the existing 35deg per-frame gate (not
invented, not tuned to one face), and an UNVALIDATED stamp on every
logged record until it is tested across real people the same way V_bf/
V_es/V_pd were at Gate 2 (see compute_v_so's docstring for the exact
validation hook this needs).

HONEST FRAMING (as strict as the V/A rules): V_so measures a geometric
fact -- is the head/gaze pointed at the screen -- and is labeled "screen
orientation" everywhere. It NEVER claims "attention" or "engagement":
those are mental-state inferences a camera cannot measure (a person can
be squarely oriented at the screen and mentally elsewhere). Any UI/log/
report text describing V_so must say "orientation", never "attention"/
"engagement".

GLASSES-ROBUST BY CONSTRUCTION: PRIMARY signal is head pose (yaw/pitch),
which glasses do not affect at all. SECONDARY signal is gaze (iris
position within the eye, from the same iris landmarks V_es already
reuses) -- a BONUS refinement applied ONLY when the iris landmarks pass
a geometric plausibility check, NEVER a dependency, because glasses are
exactly what corrupts iris tracking (Pitfall #4) via lens reflections.
If gaze is unusable this frame, V_so falls back to head-pose-only and
says so in its own logged record -- it never fails or goes silent just
because gaze isn't available.

V_so is NOT composited into Valence or Arousal (attention is not
affect) and needs NO per-person calibration (unlike V_bf/V_es/V_pd,
"oriented toward screen" is a universal geometric threshold, same
category as the quality gate's yaw>35deg check, not a deviation-from-
neutral concept) -- so it is measured and logged from frame 1, windowed
on its own independent 10s clock (AttentionWindowAccumulator), never
touching WindowAccumulator or NeutralCalibrator.

VALIDATION PREP: the cluster is exposed as THREE separate, independently
scoreable fields (sample records and window summaries alike), same
discipline as Gate 2 scoring V_bf/V_es/V_pd per-vector rather than as
one blended number -- "screen_orientation" (head/eyes toward screen),
"gaze_direction" (bonus, ALWAYS paired with a gaze_reliable flag so a
scorer can exclude unreliable-gaze windows), and "look_away_rate" (1 -
oriented_rate, an honestly-labeled proxy -- never "distraction" or
"disengagement"). All three carry "unvalidated": True until a Gate-2-
style directed capture ("look at screen"/"look away"/"look down" on
command) scores them across real people. This is a pure reshape of
values compute_v_so already produced -- no new per-frame computation.

--- PILOT STATUS (post-validation finding, documentation only) ---
V_so is a PILOT feature, NOT POC-ready, and is NOT wired into the demo
UI as an attention reading (stage3_demo_ui.py reads ONLY its yaw_deg
field, surfaced as a clearly-labelled EXPERIMENTAL badge; pitch, the
blended orientation_score and oriented are never displayed). Directed
testing found: YAW (left/right) is detected reliably. PITCH (looking
up/down) is NOT USABLE for ROI attribution -- but the reason recorded
here previously was wrong, and is RETRACTED.

RETRACTED, DO NOT REINSTATE: the claim that on a maximal, sustained,
verified chin-to-chest look-down "MediaPipe-derived pitch stayed
~0.1deg", and that the root cause was STRUCTURAL and not fixable here.
No documented verification method for that figure ever existed in this
repository (docs/ROI_FEASIBILITY.md 2.4a found this first), and a real,
graded-intensity, independently-judged capture contradicts it: maximal
held look-down attempts registered pitch as large as -43.1deg (-31.6deg
and -15.2deg averages across two attempts, both judged "genuine maximal"
in real time BEFORE any number was shown), with magnitude scaling
roughly with commanded intensity (small ~6deg, medium ~2-3deg, maximal
~15-32deg). Data: logs/orientation_trials.jsonl, graded_pitch_capture.py.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG -- the current, evidence-backed position:
FACE DETECTION RATE collapses during look-down (0.08% to 27.5% across
the graded attempts), even on the attempts where pitch DID register at
large magnitude. Because most window-samples are MISSING rather than
present-and-centred, oriented_rate still reads close to 1.0. That is a
MISSINGNESS artefact, not a reading of "oriented". Two facts remain
unexplained and must not be smoothed over: a sign inconsistency between
the medium and maximal readings, and why detection collapses this hard.

CONSEQUENCE -- UNCHANGED: pitch-based ROI attribution is not viable
today, and a yaw-only signal cannot honestly be presented as
"attention"/"engagement"/"focus"/"distraction", because the most common
disengagement cue is looking down. Doing so would overclaim, the same
dishonesty the pain-axis rule (V_bf) forbids.
MECHANISM -- NOW OPEN: face foreshortening remains a plausible
contributor, and yaw_pitch_roll_from_matrix remains provably exact on
synthetic rotations, but "structural, not fixable here" is no longer a
position this docstring may assert. The M1/M2/M3 question in
docs/ROI_FEASIBILITY.md 2.4a is REOPENED, not closed.

DO NOT tune pitch here on the strength of this comment (G2). Any change
is pilot work with its own pre-registered test.
